Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?”
We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale?
The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption.
Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018.
Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg']",/@_ericelliott?source=post_page---byline--b4142f38df20---------------------------------------

I’ve seen thousands of resumes, interviewed hundreds, and hired or helped hire dozens, so I’ll describe exactly what I’m looking for when I’m presented with your application.
In the US, documents describing your qualifications and work history are called résumés. In the EU and elsewhere known as a curriculum vitae, or CV. Either way, the purpose is the same: a relatively short document which summarizes your skills, work history, education, contact information, and anything else that can be used to estimate your “fit” for a given position.
I’m based in the US, so I’ll give a US-centric view of resumes, but I’ll attempt to point out differences with CVs in areas in which I’m familiar.
A resume is required as part of almost every job application. If you see a job listing online and click “Apply,” the next page will almost certainly ask you for your contact information and a resume file.

Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes.
When we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior, we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system, understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications.
We can useApache JMeterfor load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java, so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As perJMeter website, it is defined as mentioned below :
InstallJMeteron your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter.
We first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor, so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*5xu9lN02R-XY-CvD.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yAqDFIFA5F_NXalOJKz4TA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*yAqDFIFA5F_NXalOJKz4TA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*yAqDFIFA5F_NXalOJKz4TA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*5xu9lN02R-XY-CvD.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*5xu9lN02R-XY-CvD.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@mitesh_shamra?source=post_page---byline--af189dd6f805---------------------------------------

2018was a year in which design failed us. Sure, there were some bright spots, but in so many cases, software and hardware design seemed to miss the mark. We learned more and more about how tech companies are using design to deceive us, inciting us to share more data, buy more things, and spend more time with their products — but the failures of tech companies paled in comparison to the poor ballot and voting machine design of the midterm elections.
These are some of the biggest design failures of a year that offered plenty of them.
Though Apple released its most advanced phone ever this year, other aspects of its hardware design left much to be desired.

Why is it necessary to write unit test requires another article to explain. But for a brief explanation, I will tell you several things.
I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because, when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test, it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it, but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes.
Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually, which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests, but that is not the subject of this post.
It should be clear already, but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FT9XsHGlbCsKvWgeX8lE4A.jpeg']",/@mstryoda?source=post_page---byline--4b7d9dc2b772---------------------------------------

I don’t doubt for a moment that the hype around machine learning has roots in some amazing accomplishments, many of which I use almost daily, but when it comes to how the technology affects the world of photography, we need to dig deeper. The story really does start with recent innovations in machine learning, more specifically, the machine learning algorithms that support computer vision. Yes, you could go back further and delve into some of the work done during the last Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence “Winter” but that’s digging a bit deeper than we need to illustrate why the future of photography depends on these technologies.This CNET postcomes close to getting the point across on what the future impact of this technology might be but lacks some real-world examples. What it does get right is that the recent combination within smartphones of machine learning and the latest image processing techniques is what gives us this glimpse into the future of photography.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-iVQZzi2BASLF6Bj9_qIMQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-iVQZzi2BASLF6Bj9_qIMQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-iVQZzi2BASLF6Bj9_qIMQ@2x.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@robert.rittmuller?source=post_page---byline--135437e66a8d---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@MikeFernandez/2018-year-in-review-for-southern-california-tech-1be84db9d343?source=tag_archive---------15-----------------------,2018 Year in Review for Southern California Tech,"['The Unicorn Club Keeps Growing', 'Strong Exits Across the Region', 'The Scooter Invasion', 'The Housing Crisis and Looking Ahead', 'Written by Mike Fernandez']",2,6 min read,Mike Fernandez,"Last month marked my five year anniversary as an investor. I first moved back to Los Angeles to join the world of venture capital in 2013, when the tech ecosystem in Southern California looked very different than it does today. Long time LA fund GRP Partners had justrebrandedas Upfront Ventures, moving its office from Century City to Santa Monica. The biggest recent exits were for Cornerstone OnDemand, Riot Games, and Demand Media. GQ had recently named Abbot Kinneythe coolest block in America, but the Snap-driven tech transformation of Venice was still in its infancy. Greater Southern California had a long history of building strong tech businesses, but still felt like it wasn’t living up to it’s full potential.
Since then, Southern California has been on a roll. Major exits for companies like Oculus VR, BlackLine, and Lynda.com have shown that Southern California can build successful companies in diverse industries. Greg Bettinelli’s list of SoCal investors hasexploded in length. And everybody in the Bay Area seems to be moving to SoCal, or at least talking about it. The trend continued with in 2018, in which Southern California saw a record number of unicorn financing rounds, several strong exits, and the emergence of what was arguably 2018’s hottest venture-backed company.
According to CB Insights (plus two possible additions of Fair and Seismic right at the finish line of the year), seven companies joined the Unicorn club in Southern California in 2018. Perhaps what is most notable about these companies is their diversity in industries. For years, naysayers downplayed Los Angeles startups in particular as being too focused on consumer and media markets, and lacking expertise in enterprise software or deep tech. In 2018’s unicorn batch we see industries ranging from healthcare to law to HVAC — no media or CPG this year. Santa Monica is heavily represented on the list, but the surprise runner up city was Glendale, which counts both LegalZoom and ServiceTitan as residents. Already home to the edtech unicorn Age of Learning, Glendale has quietly emerged as a major center for tech hiring in Southern California, far away from the hype of Venice or the laboratories of La Jolla.
By far the biggest news story of 2017 for the Southern California tech ecosystem was the IPO of Snap. In just a little over five years from launching, the company had managed to change the way that teens communicate, build a serious competitor to Facebook’s social media dominance (spurning acquisition offers in the process), and turn the neighborhood of Venice on its head as at spread into every square foot of available office space. Shortly after Snap went public, many LA tech watchers were left wondering, what’s next?
Perhaps the theme of big SoCal exits in 2018 was perseverance. Santa Barbara-based Sonos finally went public in August, a full sixteen years after its founding. Carlsbad-based Luxtera announced a major acquisition by Cisco seventeen years after its founding. And Amazon acquired Santa Monica-based Ring, which Shark Tank investorspublicly rejectedon national television. These three exits showed that the vast majority of companies are not overnight successes, and they require time and patience to build in the face of constant detractors.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*8RUE5JX7V14mqZAQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--1be84db9d343---------------------------------------

I’ve based several of my projects on it. I reference it as a great product while citing examples during class discussions. And you’ll constantly find me advocating for it as the best music streaming service available.
This isn’t quite simply because I think Daniel Ek(the founder) is a genius, it’s also because I think the product is a beauty all by itself.
So as I look at this IDEO Pop Quiz question “What product do you find the most relevant & interesting?” — to me it‘s a no brainer. Ithasto be Spotify.
Why, you ask?
Well for one, think about what our lives looked like before Spotify. Here in India, you’d find people from all walks of life pirating music and then liberally sharing it with their friends. Even a child will be able to tell you that it’s difficult for an artist to make a living in a society like that.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mDhF9X4VO0rCrJvWFatyxg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*36YVjRXTVl_UtnrNjXbPLw.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@viba?source=post_page---byline--9842b3447f5a---------------------------------------

Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best, but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you, “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?”
We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest, or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale?
The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks, and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React, Angular, and Vue.js, primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption.
Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen, but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018.
Interestingly, all three frameworks are still growing exponentially, year over year.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fegbK6HDD8crwrwARuMhaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*VZfJFJj5oVmZ5WzlrgSmRg.jpeg']",/@_ericelliott?source=post_page---byline--b4142f38df20---------------------------------------

Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC.
Woah — this is thefifth editionof my year in review!! (See2014,2015,2016,2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones!
I created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days, usually mid-work week, but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out:
I’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year, but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms, morning + afternoon coffees), coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah, sometimes making dinner, and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much, but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like:
A huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here, I was able to switch over to another team, Azure IoT, that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews, interviews, wrapping up work, starting new work, everything falling apart, starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However, it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive, challenging, fast-paced, and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NlGwxvL9f-s9bIZIDwJ6DA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NlGwxvL9f-s9bIZIDwJ6DA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NlGwxvL9f-s9bIZIDwJ6DA.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--7d6d1177066b---------------------------------------

Having PSVR as number one may be a little controversial, as PSVR is solely focused on gaming, and most people believe that VR extends beyond gaming. However, there is no denying the success of PSVR.

“This app is about love for conservatives by conservatives,” declared Righter founder Christy Edwards Lawton, the die-hard Trump supporter who spoke withVoxabout leftist hegemony over the market. “I think people should date who they want to date.

It’s been another year of relentless artificial-intelligence hype and incremental AI achievement. Machines still beat humans only in carefully constructed environments or at narrow tasks. The good news is that, as the technology progresses, the race for leadership is still wide open, and even Europe, where politicians fret that the continent is lagging behind China and the U.S., is still quite competitive.
According to the Artificial Intelligence Index 2018 annualreport, whose steering committee includes leading AI scholars such as Yoav Shoham of Stanford University and Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI has progressed on all the measures tracked. Some of the metrics, from the number of published papers and conference attendance, to mentions on corporate earnings calls and in parliamentary hearings, measure the hype.

The hard work of our technology and partner team will come to fruition in early January with the launch of a strategic alliance between BLOCKv and one of the world’s leading technology companies, Intel, along with the announcement of a new partner to the BLOCKv ecosystem.
On January 12th in New York City Project NGAGE will launch at the National Retail Federation Big Show (NRF). Project NGAGE is an Intel-led initiative, bringing together BLOCKv, CataBoom, and leading retail brands to demonstrate how gamified digital objects on blockchain deliver more engaging customer experiences with improved metrics and longer-term customer value.
BLOCKv has partnered with Intel, game design company CataBoom and London-based virtual and augmented reality company Austella, to develop a showcase retail experience that includes a customized viewer and a new type of Vatom utilizing smart brain functionality. With the help of Intel, we have brought on dozens of major technology and retail brands to participate in Project NGAGE at NRF from January 12th through the 15th.
Also in January, we’ll announce a new BLOCKv partner founded by three digital advertising and blockchain pioneers. Their offering will target the advertising industry with a focus on disrupting conventional digital media and social marketing practices using Vatoms. With BLOCKv APIs and expanding development tools, they will bring a new asset class to advertisers to help solve pressing industry issues related to privacy, security, audience engagement and declining ROI.
Finally, at the end of January, BLOCKv will exhibit at the Blockchain Gamer Connects and Pocket Gamer Connects conferences in London on the 21st and 22nd respectively. These conferences are aimed at the emerging and vibrant blockchain gaming development community in the UK. If you are planning to attend the conference, BLOCKv will present our platform to attendees on the Blockchain stage on January 21st. And we look forward to meeting all of you to discuss the next generation of gaming.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*loI_6H8O7IVDaMALveDDAg.jpeg']",/@blockv?source=post_page---byline--d58d0fb771a1---------------------------------------

Toyota Motor Corp. has sold enough cars to put one outside every Japanese home. Now it wants to put robots inside.
Well-known for its automated assembly lines, Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes, helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone.
Machines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet, every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic, physical problem: the stronger a robot gets, the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves, a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor, Gill Pratt, heading its effort.
“This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them,” said Morten Paulsen, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co., who’s covered the robotics industry for decades.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*rO6YSqzbHG56iNxqAveFYw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*aFLLGsE20mi1mOuO8HH9ug.jpeg']",/@bloomberg?source=post_page---byline--da5c45381448---------------------------------------

But, in 2005, she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net, severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short, she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved, but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So,Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her.
Slawnych is maker, and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell, who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro tosnap photos, and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic, the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release, but also panning and tilting.
The device Slawnych came up with sits inside a3D-printedenclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components. Those arean Arduino, servos, and microphone. By interpreting Pioro’s voice commands, the device can pan, tilt, and trigger the camera so she can shoot all the photos she likes on her own. Slawnych even took the device to Canon Canada, who has expressed interest in expanding the design to include zoom functionality.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg']",/@cameroncoward?source=post_page---byline--37178db470ea---------------------------------------

The keys to a successful community
Have you ever wondered why some communities succeed long-term and some don’t, why do they break and what makes people leave them?
I’ve researched what are some characteristics and prerequisites for creating successful online communities. There are many categories and subcategories and a lot of literature.Stan Garfield,the legendary Community evangelist has done extensive research on this and according to him, these are 3 keys to communities of practice.
The first two points are clear — you need a common topic of interest that the members of the community share, and you need enough people to create that community.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*K72EjimF7M9Np8dkufxf3g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*K72EjimF7M9Np8dkufxf3g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*K72EjimF7M9Np8dkufxf3g.png']",https://medium.com/@theeylon?source=post_page---byline--a43c9746a207---------------------------------------

It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test, to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence.
What we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community.
I’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure, then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point, it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far.
Going through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back, it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions.
Of course, there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly, there were also sad moments this year.

While data literacy has a long way to go, this is an important first step.
Judicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management, increased financial security, and improved medical decisions, to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation, improve allocation of tax revenues, and define better policies and treaties, increasing overall happiness, transparency, and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity.
If you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised, well,you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here.
Firstly, we have difficulty at times recognising progress, instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommendFactfulness, theBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters, and theNew York Times’ Week in Good News.
The second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data, analytics, and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress, e.g.machine translationandcomplex board games. However, in others we are only in our infancy, and many organisations are not realising the value they could, both due to technical and behavioural hurdles.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*LkoGE9SHCNaueTY1rU7yjA.jpeg']",/@denrooijen?source=post_page---byline--35899cb60d03---------------------------------------

The decision left many assuming that the same fate would await their iOS app and indeed as 2018 ended so to did the option of subscribing to Netflix through the Apple App Store.
This comes after many developers have voiced their upset over the percentage both Apple and Google take of any in-app purchase. Both companies used to take 30% but in more recent years cut that figure to 15%. Still tensions have remained high between developers and the two tech giants.
Netflix isn’t the first company to do this, it’s one of many. Spotify pulled the option to subscribe in-app on iOS. Amazon limits movie and tv-show rentals through Prime Video to its website; Purchasing Kindle books isn’t available through their Kindle app either. Epic Games opted to release Fortnite on Android purposely not on the Google Play store to avoid Google taking a cut on in-game purchases.
So just how much are companies like Apple and Google profiting off of these subscriptions? Netflix on iOS was grossing approximately $2.4 million a day in 2018, Apple’s cut would be around $700,000 of that figure.
According to Sensor Tower, to date Netflix has generated $1.5 billion in in-app subscriptions, meaning Apple took home a comfortable $450 million+. It’s not entirely surprising why these companies are opting for the less user-friendly options and it also makes you wonder whether any other apps on the top-grossing list will consider making the jump.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9dErtMvivEcc6uxG9O57Hw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*9dErtMvivEcc6uxG9O57Hw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*9dErtMvivEcc6uxG9O57Hw.jpeg']",https://glenwhillier.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--5b253b8337f1---------------------------------------

So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity, and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers, personalize their experience, and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking,” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture, is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level, including achieving immortality.
Sound familiar?
This future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously, the future is not just unevenly distributed, it is also taking a really long time to arrive.
Incrementalism is the new disruption, and pragmatism the new moonshot.

These will complement my birthday posts and hopefully everything else I write. Sometimes my writings will be brief, and at other times lengthier. Birthday posts are more reflective and centered about my own personal development and evolution while these posts will be more forward looking and touch on subjects well beyond the subjective. There will be some overlap, though, and I’m quite okay with that.
Last year’s New Year’s resolution was to have no resolution and live life with no particular goals or aims; to ‘do nothing.’ My intent was simply to take a break. I’d say I largely succeeded and an unplanned side effect was trading off productivity for awareness. I spent more time observing the world and those around me. I spent less time in my own head and more empathizing with others. I suspect dealing with unexpected death, loss, pain, and accidents that happen to have occurred this year was easier than it would have otherwise been in this frame of mind, though of course one can never really know.
If I failed in trying to do nothing, it was in doing something. It turns out it’s really hard to do nothing. But let’s say for the sake of exposition that I sufficiently well approximated doing nothing, insofar as feasible. I ask that you grant me some latitude and that we just agree to call whatever I was doing ‘doing nothing.’
Something funny happens when you’re ‘doing nothing.’ It’s almost like what happens when you eat nothing.
I’ve really taken to fasting because I enjoy the exercise of will power required to resist hunger. There may or may not be health benefits to this; I don’t know and frankly don’t care. I simply enjoy the feeling. The type of hunger that you experience after not eating for 48+ hours is very different from the hunger you feel when you skip a meal or are excessively stressed.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*XRRwxTgSNWk1CMWIwYhE2g@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*XRRwxTgSNWk1CMWIwYhE2g@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*XRRwxTgSNWk1CMWIwYhE2g@2x.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--49f8353b29fc---------------------------------------

Em 1893 graduou-se no Smith College, em Northampton e, após ensinar matemática por dois anos em Denver e zoologia no Smith College por um ano, ela foi a primeira mulher a ser aceita na Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, no ano de 1896, onde construiu uma grande reputação por conta das suas pesquisas em embriologia e histologia. Florence se tornou uma anatomista, por isso acredito que a pergunta do início do texto lhe era muito recorrente.
Um outro grande feito de Florence Rena é que ela foi a primeira mulher eleita para a National Academy of Sciences e uma das primeiras mulheres médicas norte-americanas a construir carreira como pesquisadora.
Em 1900, recebeu o título de Doutora pela Johns Hopkins e em 1901 publicou “An Atlas of the Medulla and Midbrain”, um livro de texto sobre medicina que se tornou muito popular na época. No ano seguinte, a Johns Hopkins finalmente revogou sua política de não contratar mulheres e ela passou então a integrar o staff de pesquisadores. Destacou-se como pesquisadora do sistema linfático, onde reformulou a explicação tradicional do desenvolvimento do mesmo, provando que o desenvolvimento das veias no embrião ocorre fora em tecidos.
Foi ainda professora de histologia na Johns Hopkins University entre 1917 e 1925, e membro do Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research entre 1925 e 1938, onde se aposentou e tornou-se emérita. Voltou a morar em Denver, Colorado, onde trabalhou para o governo do estado.

One such techno/human fusion is Twitter, a place where somewhat slow-changing society and culture comes up hard against fast changing technology, creating inevitable emotional turbulence and much uncertainty, while furiously generating and spreading new ideas and new concepts. That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views, as annoying as this sometimes is.
I came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature, technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck, self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores.
It suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score, with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and, if I were a betting man, I’d put money onmostpeople thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant.
I wondered, would it actually be awful?

1. Main chain
INT public chain was first released on 1st February 2018. Since then, INT team has carried out code refactoring and layering, developed an upgraded version of the chain which is more applicable for actual application scenarios in IoT, and released a global public beta version of the chain. After several months of R&D in core design, INT team successfully implemented a P2P network communication protocol, consensus algorithm, and smart contracts, and released a working testnet on 14th December 2018. At present, INT team is following up on feedback submitted by users and community to continue improving the main chain. Mainnet, token swap, and node election are expected to be launched in mid-late January.
2. Wallet and explorer

From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook, Apple’s devices lookstunning. However, if you’ve owned an iPhone, you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like manyonline, I’ve always wondered:
It sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals, unending battery life, and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal?
When Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015, it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes, but in person, the main reaction was tolook at it.
If you thought that was a one-off, take a look at whatpeople were sayingabout the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros.
Apple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it, so Apple wants to create a positive first impression.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*WaMqgO4PqDGCxbsBSb6oaA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AnYKil3t9Yn1S2FJjNTMAw.png']",/@isaacy2012?source=post_page---byline--70b6c686bac8---------------------------------------

今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。
對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。
除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。
最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*b9cV58bmMBoxsiM2IrLTDg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*ws5N5y6-441oBzIFQoGihw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ws5N5y6-441oBzIFQoGihw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ws5N5y6-441oBzIFQoGihw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*b9cV58bmMBoxsiM2IrLTDg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*b9cV58bmMBoxsiM2IrLTDg.jpeg']",/@Wes_Hsu?source=post_page---byline--656a22db8568---------------------------------------

Or at the very least, certainly the most influential.
If you doubt that fact, consider this: Shortly after its release, the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result, many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing, those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future.
In short, we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today, whether they have an Apple logo or not, were made in Apple’s image.
But 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple, especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design, Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate, iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been.
Though the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first, many reviews praised the iPhone X, calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact, there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018, the hype was only just starting to dissipate.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*nFcir7Ilflnu9BSPJ2ze1g@2x.jpeg']",https://daneoleary.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--21a06d1f82db---------------------------------------

https://medium.com/@saxberg/internet-of-things-shaping-our-future-today-f4d33b1534b3?source=tag_archive---------56-----------------------,Internet of Things — shaping our future today,['Written by Natasha F Saxberg'],1,3 min read,Natasha F Saxberg,"Internet of Things (IoT) is a well known buzzword, many people might have heard about for a couple of decades. At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies, platforms, and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives, since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting, anything from cars, jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality.
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED.
Industry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future, from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology, the key interaction will be human, since IoT objects will not only be connected to things, but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions, remotely control a robot, perform heart surgery in a refugee camp, or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available, smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of
1.5 billion units shipped in 2016, up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there, shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing, enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things.

https://medium.com/the-looking-glass/innovation-elevation-a-myth-and-some-initial-observations-by-isa-lacuna-34655c860f3e?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,Innovation Elevation: A Myth and Some Initial Observations by Isa Lacuna,"['About the author:', 'Published in John Clements Lookingglass', 'Written by Shiela Manalo', 'No responses yet']",,7 min read,Shiela Manalo,"I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists, as the theme presupposes, as the themevehemently desires) because the word is, in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination, aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before, when I was still in advertising, the rallying call was always to innovate (products, mediums, taglines, points-of-purchase, packaging designs, greeting cards, literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put, everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate, ceaselessly and relentlessly, across all disciplines and all positions, and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years, I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation, to the point that not only has it become nonsensical, in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly, automatically, and fervently, but also tortuous in its endlessness.
As a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out, in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically.
Innovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century, from the Latininnovat- ‘renewed, altered’ from the verbinnovare, fromin- ‘into’ +novare‘make new’ (fromnovus‘new’).² Interestingly, it was first used as a kind of invective, one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules, and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were, contextually, undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures.
It was a combination of the scientific turn, the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically, Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “definedinventionas an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import, whileinnovationhappens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here, economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention, and up until now, we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit, because then it would be similar to art, which, while uplifting, is not financially remunerative. Or, if you would like to state it in another way, you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art, but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation.
Fast forward to 1991, wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition, but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes), at ever greater rates of turnover, now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic, and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life, our psychic experience, our cultural languages, are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words, there really is nothing new about the new, or the way we think about the new. In fact, we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing onAngelus Novus, which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft, more intolerable, and more alienated to real human conditions, than the present that births it.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg']",/@iamsimone02?source=post_page---byline--34655c860f3e---------------------------------------

So I came up with my own list, except these are not predictions per se — after all, I’m no shaman and I can’t see the future. Instead, the ideas on this list — they are simply in the air and I’m only channeling them. Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019, whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades.
With de-globalization picking up steam, deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand, it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples, Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities, which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole, to strengthened geopolitical position of the country.
In another consequence of fragmenting global markets, the pace of innovation is slowing down, especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists, their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success, especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power, tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean, how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room, including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done, however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals.
As the ancient wisdom says, nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token, it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape, we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately, core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays, compared to Business degrees for example. In fact, hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings, according tosome studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum, we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science, for example, becomes more desirable than an MBA!
It is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature, for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress, for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally, technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age, but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress, which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*EDmfJrG3xlk9ucn2nCy2dw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EDmfJrG3xlk9ucn2nCy2dw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EDmfJrG3xlk9ucn2nCy2dw.jpeg']",/@andre.podnozov?source=post_page---byline--2892543274ad---------------------------------------

In recent years, Instagram has grown considerably from an app that shares photos amongst friends into a social network where users can interact with friends and many different forms of media. A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen, as well as a standalone app, IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators.
IGTV enables anyone to be a creator, not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally oniOSandAndroid, as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos, or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos, popular videos, creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content.
IGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences, e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV.
Instagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content, but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic, personalized curation and a narrower set of sources, Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*XvKuvCId1magXp8V5hiijw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*XvKuvCId1magXp8V5hiijw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*XvKuvCId1magXp8V5hiijw.jpeg']",/@rushsavge?source=post_page---byline--c87fde16f070---------------------------------------

Good news to every mobile subscriber who has excess mobile data out there! Now, you have a choice!
An international award winning start-up, Simplify, has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible, Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember, there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access.
The company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income, tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming.
Interestingly, Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota.
If you fall under the first two categories, Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash, and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell, for example RM8/GB.

It’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media, asthis Atlantic article notes. But that was all warm-up compared to election 2016.
Very early on Hillary’s army took to the trenches, making moves to gain an advantage. According toNick Allen’s article in The Telegraph, “Mrs Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of hi-tech messages on Facebook.”","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*iO1iqVuK2MbHbZ0z-bd0fQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--46666d28c063---------------------------------------

A Software Engineering Manager was deemed by LinkedIn to be the 2nd most promising job of 2018,having a year over year growth of 38% and a Career Advancement score of 8/10.In today’s business environment, the demand for “tech skills” is only increasing with technology playing a pivotal role in core business operations. Employers are intensifying their search for tech-enthusiasts who have built up the skills to be able to thrive in this ever-changing industry.
It isn’t just the technology industry that is driving demand for those with tech skills; it is becoming a prominent trend across industries. In sales, big data analysis can produce higher quality lead generation and increased revenue. In marketing, candidates with knowledge of SEO, HTML, and CSSare more likely to stand out from the crowd. Even in the Finance industry those with knowledge of Python are more highly valued by recruiters. Experience with AI, data science talent, cybersecurity, mobile application development, programming knowledge, and coding and engineering experience are just some of thetop tech skills that have been referenced by Forbes to be in high demand for 2018.

7.5 billion dollars.
That’s the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure, GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders, but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE, Visual Studio Code? Nope, as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft, it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead, with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code, it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not).
GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own, and their scale, tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board, Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact, let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella.
This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago, Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone, Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing, Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition, Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia, where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and, with his latest move, it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves, opening his arms to open source software.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*oye36JFYHUkXtKbgogB9DA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*r63T2fdIcQOSa2ltNSHHkQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*r63T2fdIcQOSa2ltNSHHkQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*r63T2fdIcQOSa2ltNSHHkQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*oye36JFYHUkXtKbgogB9DA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*oye36JFYHUkXtKbgogB9DA.jpeg']",/@mayankkishore?source=post_page---byline--6c43621ff208---------------------------------------

In 2018, cryptocurrency markets continued to show growth in regions across the globe, showcasing the world’s desire to exercise more control over their finances.

No one could imagine using Word and Excel, let alone AR & VR, on a brick-sized object which didn’t make you even look slick. But features such as GPRS, instant messaging and, most remarkably, intangible aspect “mobility”, revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices.
Such is the case with blockchain, and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand, difficult to code, difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money, documents, bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But, it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept.
How is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly, a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app, they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep.
Mass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters, nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority.
Sectors and projects that will move the needle in the blockchain space in 2019 will be the financial, insurance and retail industry and projects such asFilecoin,Protocol Labs,Origin, andPROPShave the possibility to become mainstream options to the present alternatives.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*47XeqG1b8ZSt2qC_s7fHEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*47XeqG1b8ZSt2qC_s7fHEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*47XeqG1b8ZSt2qC_s7fHEg.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@sanyalpritish?source=post_page---byline--3b1fe47fc59e---------------------------------------

I disagree, with this highly, if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all, how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough, even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.)
Working from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool), my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom, checking email, making a post, sharing a story on instagram, researching, and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things, they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology.
It’s not their fault, look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too, pondering what do adults do with these things.
Actually, tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos, taking pictures with legos, and how to make apps.
Last year, we sold the iPad, the iPod touch was long gone, and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials, videos for schoolwork, crafts and reviews for toys.

The library is a huge place, that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian, familiar with the rules, listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section, author, or title. On the internet, we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter, the rules change, the platforms change, and it can be difficult to find real news, useful information, or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate, I find we need guides, similar to librarians, who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need.
The first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements, and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations, since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian, then, is our community.
Every day I am on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, scrolling through a sea of content, liking, following, and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this, your friends to this, and anyone online does a version of this, making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste, which makes each collection of online content singular and special.
For example, I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook, which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes, and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares, and even though he is not producing original content, the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages, or a scrapbook collection.
Oscar’s product is his taste, which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation, I started a project called “CultureBucket”, in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can readhere.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6eto1O8xOxAW3OkeCe3YcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*6eto1O8xOxAW3OkeCe3YcQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*6eto1O8xOxAW3OkeCe3YcQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--9de0ae562eab---------------------------------------

We should all know that there are no such things as get-rich-quick schemes.I believe that the extreme growth of BTC last year was a flash in the pan, and that people’s “lambo” attitudes today are detrimental to the community as a whole.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cVW0-tEI3FKVWY72OGjdAQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*jcLedXSHDi-9sng0nbJl6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*jcLedXSHDi-9sng0nbJl6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*jcLedXSHDi-9sng0nbJl6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*cVW0-tEI3FKVWY72OGjdAQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*cVW0-tEI3FKVWY72OGjdAQ.png']",/@rhiannonpayne?source=post_page---byline--4642b659c696---------------------------------------

When technology has existed for a while we forget how sometimes there is a security risk involved in using it. This can be said about the file directory navigation system.
Since the first computer system came out the hierarchical file structure could be navigated through the command line system. After operating systems improved and GUI (graphical user interfaces) systems evolved the computer’s internal file structure could be traversed through a GUI interface. Of course, with every new advancement comes new exploitation. Cyber criminals that gain access to your hardware can download sensitive documents with 2 to 3 clicks of a mouse. As a precautionary measure you could put a password on your work folder and make it more difficult to obtain your documents — but once that password is cracked, then it’s all for naught.
To resolve this problem IBM has crafted an innovative piece of technology called the Decoy File system (DcyFS). Like layering a cake, the DcyFS overlays a custom view that can do each of the following:
The DcyFS system provides write control on documents you designate as “sensitive.” With documents given the “sensitive” tag, the DcyFS system replaces those files with fakes. In addition it can also create a honeypot trap by adding fake documents to entice cyber criminals looking to steal information. Once the “honey pot” is accessed it will leave a forensic trail for specialists to analyze and identify the users main objective.

You can practically hear him saying it. ‘Fake news’.
I’m here to tell you, that you, are (probably) fake news.
If you have a social media account, the chances are you are at least vaguely aware of your online image, you know what you have uploaded to your profile(s) and you don’t put any old toot up there. Why? It’s because, whether you admit it or not, you want to look good in the eyes of others. From the profile picture you set, to the daily, weekly or monthly posts you make (depending on how much of a lurker you are) you are making decisions about how you want people to perceive you; a physical image and a personality image. A cherry-picked impression of the real life you. You, but through rose coloured spectacles.
I’m not going to tell you this is a terrible thing that you shouldn’t do. After all, you should be careful what you put online these days, especially with nosy potential employers turning to social media to get a behind-the-curtain look at prospectus employees and their habits. However, when you start to see other people’s online profiles, it can be easy to forget that they do the exact same thing. In fact, according to the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’¹ 36% of people aged 18–34 admitted they deceive their social media followers with their posts, making their holidays seem greater than they were. The main reasons for doing this were to either make their followers envious, or to try and one up the other accounts they followed on social media.
This can end up giving the rather depressing impression that your life only has great bits in a sea of mediocrity, but everybody else is always having an absolutely great time. All the time. It unsurprising then, that social media users tend to have be more depressed¹. It’s important to maintain perspective when using social media, as the saying goes, ‘the grass is always greener on the other side’. Well now the other side is covered in flowers, puppies are everywhere and the old worn-down shed is covered by Potter’s cloak of invisibility. It’s hard not to be dissatisfied with your own patchy grass when faced with that.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SbgVVPem8_-V1hI-VbBAeA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*AgPo4zCjCYJInv6pSOhw_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AgPo4zCjCYJInv6pSOhw_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AgPo4zCjCYJInv6pSOhw_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SbgVVPem8_-V1hI-VbBAeA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SbgVVPem8_-V1hI-VbBAeA.jpeg']",/@j.m.s.biddle96?source=post_page---byline--41c04d48b30a---------------------------------------

Microfiber can rightly be called theapartment cleaningmaterial of the XXI century. Its properties are truly unique, which is why it is so often used to clean a variety of surfaces. From this material, you will learn about the history of creation, composition, characteristics, and applications of microfiber.
Microfiber was developed in 1976 in Japan, but its widespread production became possible (and economically viable) only after several years. However, immediately after the invention of this unusual material in allmaid servicerespects, the world appreciated the revolutionary discovery and the opportunities that had opened up.
Thecleaning servicesmaterial consists of only two substances — polyester (forming fiber) and nylon (forming the core) in a ratio of 4/1. The resulting tissue has millions of microscopic triangular pores. They quickly absorb water (ten times faster than any other material) and absorb dust using contact electrification. The liquid then evaporates quickly, and the dirt lingers in the pores of the microfiber cloth.
The reason why microfiber retains dust so well is the improperly branched structure of microscopic triangular pores. This is what allows it to surpass its counterparts so much — gauze, paper, and various special cleaning materials.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*M0HaoVqmakOzK_m1Y-Hauw.png']",/@anna.frankfurt86?source=post_page---byline--1396783645f2---------------------------------------

A helpful ad on Google will match a searcher’s keywords with a relevant landing page, but redirect ads provide counter-messaging and often alternative destinations that go against the search words.
For example, if you search Google for “iPhone 6S,” you’re predictably going to be shown an ad for the iPhone 6S. By clicking that ad, you’ll probably land on a page where you can buy one. A redirect ad, however, might twist your search and prompt you with something like this for a Galaxy S6 instead:
In this example, Samsung is trying to swerve the searcher’s intent with counter-messaging and is betting the searcher will question their brand loyalty, click the ad, and convert from Apple to Samsung.

As my first task, I had a small bug fix that would help in stabilizing future versions of the service. My team explained the architecture of the service to me and where do we fit in the grand scheme of the larger project. It was on me to find where the code had to be added/deleted or modified to make the bug fix.
I started digging through the code base, most of which had been created in the last two years. By no standard, it was legacy code. As I went deeper and deeper into it, I found myself with quite profane thoughts. To say that code was not aesthetically pleasing, would be a mild way to put it.

Alibaba Cloud recently announced that it has open sourced Mars — its tensor-based framework for large-scale data computation — on Github.Mars can be regarded as “a parallel and distributed NumPy.” Mars can tile a large tensor into small chunks and describe the inner computation with a directed graph, enabling the running of parallel computation on a wide range of distributed environments, from a single machine to a cluster comprising thousands of machines.
Alibaba Cloud Senior Engineer Xuye Qin introduced Mars from a performance perspective, boasting that “Mars can complete the computation on a 2.25T-size matrix and a 2.25T-size matrix multiplication in two hours.”
Mars’ key advantage is its ability to run matrix computation at a very large-scale, a forte that NumPy does not share. The chart below illustrates a simple experiment Alibaba developers ran to test Mars’ performance: They added one and then multiplied the result ((X+1)*2) for 3.6 billion data, then tested the change in computing time as the workers number (number of machines) increased. NumPy, represented by the red cross in the upper left, lags far behind Mars tensors, whose performance approaches ideal values.

Future forecasts are not an investment thesis because innovations, no matter how exciting they are, won’t happen until the present is ready for them (and this is why the best investors are more insightful about the present than they are about the future). But if you’re a product leader, entrepreneur, or very early-stage investor, future thinking tunes your attention and instincts. It also helps you determine whether a team is attempting to defy a likely outcome or make it happen in a better way.

However, Javascript has evolved a lot in the last years. We are now able to write object-oriented JS code, withES6. (If you don’t know ES6, clickherefor more). But there is also another way with additional features:Typescript.
Typescript can be explained as a superset of Javascript. It means that every Javascript (also ES6 & newer versions) code isvalidTypescript code, but Typescript comes with some additional features:
In Typescript, we can define a variable’s type with thestrong-typingfeature like we define a variable in Java or C++. Additionally, we are able to writeobject-orientedcode with Typescript.
Another important point is that Angular uses Typescript. So if you want to learn Angular, it’s an advantage to know some Typescript first. Let’s see how to start using Typescript…","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*mNmxddJJTzkiBfK77mWuGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*8ji738JAdjAJsNM6eZ54_w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mNmxddJJTzkiBfK77mWuGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mNmxddJJTzkiBfK77mWuGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mNmxddJJTzkiBfK77mWuGA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*8ji738JAdjAJsNM6eZ54_w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*8ji738JAdjAJsNM6eZ54_w.png']",https://medium.com/@cem.eygi?source=post_page---byline--e003dbad2191---------------------------------------

It seems like a simple question that should have a simple answer, but that’s rarely the case.
Here’s something I’ve done over my 20+ years as an entrepreneur to keep everyone focused on the tasks at hand while also keeping an eye on the future.
Entrepreneurs usually blur the lines of what their startup is, what it will be, and what it should be. This is fine until you try to start planning around those stories. At that point, you need to be asking: What are the priorities today and how do we execute on those priorities without mortgaging the future? The reverse question is just as important: How much time do we spend working on those new things that aren’t generating revenue yet?
Every startup should have three stories, loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling. An easy way to think about it is a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show, the writers are usually working on three storylines:
Story A: Story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode (or maybe a two-parter).","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*jSJzFhN0IssjAReXkUsQaQ.png']",/?source=post_page---byline--3476909629bb---------------------------------------

This one made its way into the hands ofJean-Luc Aufranc, from theCNX Software blog, over the Christmas vacation.
On the face of it, this is an intriguing addition to Espressif’s product lineup. With most of themajor machine learning toolsbeing heavily optimised for Arm-based architectures, Espressif with its Tensilica-based chips is in danger of being left behind when it comes to machine learning on the edge. One of the reasons I was so excited bySeeed Studio’s Air602 modulereleased late last year is that it’s a price comparable ESP8266 competitor that’s built on Arm.
On the surface, the board itself looks a lot like a neater, more finished version of theprototype Ai-Thinker CAM boardwe saw towards the middle of last year, as well a few of the other ESP32-based camera boards I’ve seen. What’s different here is of course that this is, presumably, going to be an“official”Espressif product and that implies a better level of software support than we’ve seen before. But, at least right now, there doesn’t seem to be any details of the software stack they’re using on the board, although it’s likely to be their ownESP-WHO framework. Which is sort of interesting.
In fact, there really doesn’t seem to be manydetails of the new boardat all; there certainly isn’t any information available on theEspressifwebsite. Beyond the handful of boards that got sent out to the community over the Christmas break, the new board hasn’t made it into more general circulation. It isn’t yet for sale, and there is no word on pricing or even a release date.
So, now all I have to do is figure out how to get my hands on one…?","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*aiV4IzhhhPYJg6_SkU53LQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*aiV4IzhhhPYJg6_SkU53LQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*aiV4IzhhhPYJg6_SkU53LQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--2d5b4ffd2b9---------------------------------------

On this episode I’m visiting Atrium’s headquarters in SoMA in San Francisco to chat with two serial entrepreneurs, Justin Kan and Ranidu.
Justin Kan’s career blew up in the mid-2000s when he started livestreaming himself 24/7 on Justin.tv, a Y Combinator backed startup that he co-founded. Justin.tv eventually turned into Twitch and sold to Amazon for nearly a billion dollars. He has gone on to found multiple startups since then, includingExec,Whale, and nowAtrium.
Raniduhas a unique background. Before jumping into tech, he rose to fame as an R&B and hip-hop artist (check him outhere). He went on to join Google before founding the first of many startups, many of which have been centered around his passion for music. We talk about a few of them includingThe Drop,The Artist Union, andAudius, a decentralized audio distribution platform he started earlier this year.

https://medium.com/@levihpatton/designing-with-the-2018-ipad-pro-1971f2157d00?source=tag_archive---------14-----------------------,Designing With the 2018 iPad Pro,['Written by Levi Patton'],3,4 min read,Levi Patton,"I’ll be to the first to admit that I’m kind of impulsive. And while picking up a new 11-inch iPad Pro definitely qualifies as an impulse purchase, it’s impressive utility as a design tool has more than compensated for some of the post-impulse-purchase guilt.
Until now, I’ve never owned an iPad or ever really had the need or desire to own one. So when I picked up the 2nd generation Apple Pencil and started doodling on one of the new iPads to kill time in the Apple Store, my expectations were pretty flat. It was another super pretty piece of Apple glass with a $120 stylus. Oh, it costs another $200 to add on the ‘smart’ keyboard? Classic Apple play. Fun to mess around with on an Apple Store errand, but not something I’d actually consider shelling out for.
I sketched a couple quick figures, some portraits, and other random doodles. Whoa, this thing was pretty sleek. The interaction between the pen and the screen was impressively smooth. The sensitivity of the stylus captured my sketchy/messy drawing style surprisingly well. I’ve always loved drawing with pen and paper, but have never really transferred over to digital mediums because you tend to lose that organic feel and style. Not the case with this magic little slate. Then I tried sketching out a couple basic wireframe shapes. I drew a crooked box that I didn’t like, so I double tapped the pen to bring up the eraser in a seamless and intuitive motion, corrected the mistake, and continued on with the sketches. Uh oh. I was officially delighted.
Needless to say, I went home with the iPad with the insurance of an extended holiday return policy. I had a month and a half (instead of the usual two weeks) to explore and decide if it was worth the hefty price tag. Pack your bags Frodo, this was going to be a journey.
For the next couple of weeks, I explored a huge range of design-oriented apps to put the iPad to the test. Right off the bat, it became clear that some of the most impressive apps (unsurprisingly) belong to the Adobe family.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg']",/@levihpatton?source=post_page---byline--1971f2157d00---------------------------------------

But, your controller can definitely hold you back — nobody wants to playDr. Mariowith a computer keyboard, after all. Even if you have a controller with the correct layout, subtle differences in button feel can completely ruin the experience. But if you have a Game Boy,you can now use it as a wireless controller thanks to this special cartridge.
The Wireless Gameboy Controller Device is a cartridge that’s compatible with the original Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Color, the Game Boy Advance, and the Advance SP. It’ll turn your Game Boy of choice into a wireless controller that works with a PC, a Raspberry Pi, or a GameCube. That means you canplay a gamelikePokémon RedorBluethrough RetroPie running ona Raspberry Pi, while using an actual Game Boy Color as the controller!
The cartridge works by making your Game Boy think you’re playing an actual game. There’s nothing on the Game Boy’s screen, but the “game” still accepts all of the button inputs. Every 2ms, it checks for a button press, and sends those button presses to a wireless receiver plugged into your computer or Raspberry Pi. The receiver refreshes every 8ms, so there shouldn’t be any noticeable input lag. Simply put, it’s a streamlined solution for your using your Game Boy as a wireless controller.
Stock is limited, but you can snag a Wireless Gameboy Controller Device frominsideGadgets’ Tindie storefor $39 plus shipping. Cartridges are available in gray and clear, and include the wireless USB receiver.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg']",/@cameroncoward?source=post_page---byline--270bb2974df9---------------------------------------

Surely, with Bitcoin being the natural evolution of currency (and by extension, humanity itself), improved levels of usability should freely follow in its wake — however, as is often the case within the launch of new technologies, the final infrastructure does tend to lag several steps (or miles) behind. With Visa able to process 24,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin Cash 61 and Bitcoin a mere 7 transactions per second, its inadequacy is glaringly obvious to all members of the crypto community.
The lightning network grew into prominence during the more nascent architectural days of 2017, before its official, full-blooded incarnation in March 2018. Since then, particularly in recent months, it has travelled swiftly from strength to strength. One of the key players — and early adopters — within the lightning network space is Bitfury. Bitfury is “one of the largest full-service blockchain technology companies in the world”, providing both software and hardware solutions for businesses, governments, organizations and individuals to securely transfer assets across the blockchain network. Interestingly, Bitfury have been the first to fully implement a lightning-network based coffee-purchasing system. Their lightning network engineering team, known as LightningPeach, partnered with payments startup Paytomat in order to launch the lightning network via their platform — an all-around successful integration, garnering further faith in the Lightning Network, and pushing Paytomat up the rankings of revolutionary retribution platforms.
Lightning Labs, the infamous proponents of the Lightning Network, have achieved a significant amount over the past year: regardless of Bitcoin’s dips, its ability to travel sideways, upside down and fling itself askance in every other direction, the lightning network itself has gone from strength to strength, unfazed by market volatility. November saw the network top 4,000 nodes and before burgeoning to uphold over $2 million value of bitcoin, its capacity continuing to rise after the spiral of BTC, experiencing an increase of almost 300%. Yes, it’s still possible to remain profitable during a stark, bleak crypto midwinter. For instance, the number of crypto ATMs around the world kept growing steadily, with 209 machines opening around the world in December.
Canadian BTC mining company Hut 8 claimed a record high $13.5 million for Q3 2018, and Japanese IT giant GMO reported that its crypto businesses, including mining equipment production and its crypto exchange, gained 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) during the same period (although some fraudulent dabbling may have been involved).
Open Node, a well-seasoned, dynamic member of the lightning network conglomerate, has begun to painstakingly facilitate the launch of the ideal bitcoin payment processing system, negotiating its widespread acceptance with as many merchants as possible, including Starbucks and Tesla, according to Tim Draper’s excited tweet last month. OpenNode charge a transaction fee of 1%: as far as revenue generation goes, it’s hardly outlandish, particularly when stacked beside a successful, all-encompassing payment network.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-_aiJHzJPz655N7iSSrLrQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eqXcnzz8wiFI69MmXXE_Yg.png']",/@DigitalDoppelgangers?source=post_page---byline--f2aad299e9b3---------------------------------------

Seed stage startups often do this by fixating on a single revenue number — a million-dollar run rate.
As far as round numbers go, a million dollars of annual revenue is a great sign of progress. Once upon a time, it really was a marker that made a meaningful difference in raising a Series A, but the imaginary milestone of $83K in MRR isn’t the ticket to a Series A that it was five years ago.
Over the last half-decade, there’s been substantial inflation in round sizes, to the point where a Series A has the dimensions, and prerequisites, of what would have been closer to a Series B round 5 years ago. When evaluating decks, Series A investors won’t treat companies with $900K and $1.1M in annual revenue differently. Today, the benchmarks to land a series A often include several million dollars of revenue, accelerating at an impressive velocity, and combined with well-rounded leadership teams, and impressive customer rosters. The bar has meaningfully moved from five years ago.
Still, many founders fetishize it this one number. They insist it’s what’s keeping VCs from taking them seriously. They’ll increase their burn and spend inappropriately to get to it. And most of the time, this is a waste of focus and resources. The better advice is to grow revenue as quickly as you can, sustainably, and focus most of your attention on helping investors answer one critical question.
Venture capital is a velocity business and every good VC’s portfolio is going to have a few companies that have taken off like a rocket ship. Investors want to know why you’ll be like that company, and not one of a dozen slow-growing zombie startups from whose boards they can’t escape.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*q-oDqs62LJTpqS5zOa0F9g.png']",/?source=post_page---byline--cb0288a6eb31---------------------------------------

Cook', 'No responses yet']",,2 min read,Jeremy S. Cook,"One could argue that the state of music listening — with streaming services giving us access to a nearly limitless array of choices — has never been better. On the other hand, there is something satisfying about owning an album, and physically grabbing it from a stack of media, an experience that is lost in this virtual shuffle.
Designer Chris Pattyhas some up with a solution to this dilemma — a music player housed in a nicely finished block of wood that uses cards to select the song. Users pick a card with the single to be played out of one of two rectangular card holders, then swipe it through a mag-stripe reader slot. This type of card was chosen over the NFC variety to save costs, though according to Patty, it’s actually quite satisfying to swipe cards like this. Cleverly, the art on the cards is pulled from Spotify with a custom user interface, then printed as stick-on labels.
Under the nicely carved wooden “hood,” the system features a speaker powered by aRaspberry Pi, with songs stored locally. Patty discusses thejukebox on Twitter, including a short clip of it in action. He even reveals that he’s planning to make it open source, and will do a Kickstarter for the device for those that are less DIY-inclined.

From business class travel to chauffeured Mercedes-Benz limousine service, these scions of the semiconductor world were riding high on a wave of optimism and global consumption of smartphones hitherto unprecedented and unparalleled. But it seems that the party may be ending in the semiconductor-sphere and not just because of the looming trade war between the United States and China, but because of the laws of physics as well.
For decades, Moore’s law, (which is really an observation and not alawin the strict sense), that every two years, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles. In other words, chips (not the potato kind) are expected to do more while getting smaller. But the reality has been far different. For the early decades of chip development, Moore’s “law” was actually observed more in its contravention than in its adherence. Chips were becoming faster and smaller at a rate far in excess of Moore’s observations. Think of transistors as tiny little ON/OFF switches, which allow small amounts of current to either pass through them or not. The more transistors a chip can store, the more calculations it can make and the faster these calculations can be made.

Almost four years later, I look back on a journey of massive personal development, thanks to the rollercoaster that is working at a hyper-growth technology startup. Throughout my time at HelloFresh, change was the only constant; my role kept morphing every few months, even if the job title sometimes didn’t. The company quickly went from startup to scale-up and being an early employee on the tech team — eventually moving up to a Director of Engineering role — gave me the opportunity to amass a lot of experience in many areas: technical leadership, hiring and firing, performance management, organisational design… the list goes on.
But eventually, the time came when I felt my personal growth was no longer aligned with the company’s growth and I knew I had to move on. Being ambitious — and sometimes a little too eager — I wanted to leverage all the learnings by taking a shot at leading an engineering organisation within a smaller startup looking to scale up. I yearned to be given the trust to build a world-class engineering team. With this in mind, I started opening my ears to all the executive recruiting approaches I was getting, engaging with those I found interesting. That’s how TourRadar soon popped up on my radar and, once I went through the whole interviewing process, I had a decision to make. It has now been 3 months since I joined the company as their first VP of Engineering.
So why did I joinTourRadar?
The first thing that got me excited about TourRadar was that it seemed to be solving a problem that had not yet been truly solved — bringing multi-day touring online, a business that for the longest time was done through brick and mortar travel agencies. I quickly realised the challenges in selling this type of product online had to be very significant: a marketplace model, with high basket sizes and multiple touch points on and off-site. No wonder it was being touted as the “last frontier” of online travel.
The fact that travelling, especially for longer periods of time, can be transformative, coupled with the technical and business challenges I could perceive, made the company’s vision of “connecting people to life-enriching travel experiences” one I felt compelled to work for. And from a business perspective, it became obvious that solving this challenge at scale, with no real incumbent in sight, could mean massive upside in a global, multi-billion dollar industry.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*n-QZRjV5zzLjK_erZvR0rg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*0cpAyvfnVKjJjMI5AV0VuA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*n-QZRjV5zzLjK_erZvR0rg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*n-QZRjV5zzLjK_erZvR0rg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*n-QZRjV5zzLjK_erZvR0rg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*0cpAyvfnVKjJjMI5AV0VuA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*0cpAyvfnVKjJjMI5AV0VuA.jpeg']",/@evolutionarycoach?source=post_page---byline--ccbde8237762---------------------------------------

It is a contest where you get a theme in start and a deadline before which you need to finish and submit the game. It is like a hackathon but for game developers.
There are always 10+ game jams running simultaneously onItch.io. So you can easily find one that fits your schedule. If you are very busy you can pick a weekend one like I did.
One amazing thing about these game jams is that there are always Discord channels or Forums associated with each. Here you can post the type of work you want to do and you can team up with others that are finding you.
It can be scary most of the times to ask out someone. But has it ever been easy? Think it this way, you are here to learn. You want to enter this contest so at end of it you know a thing or two more about game development than your current self. These jams are popular enough that you will surely find another newbie teammate.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*mzVFDRTShkuCC-WUDjhYcw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Pa-FNzuv8Nx3-_C9hAywUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Pa-FNzuv8Nx3-_C9hAywUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Pa-FNzuv8Nx3-_C9hAywUw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mzVFDRTShkuCC-WUDjhYcw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mzVFDRTShkuCC-WUDjhYcw.jpeg']",/@trion?source=post_page---byline--7b77fa56c252---------------------------------------

I remember I did alright but definitely failed one or two portions of it. I also did it completely over Skype which made the whole process way more painful. Definitely not a performance I can look back on and be proud of but it did land me my first internship.
Back then, I had no idea what companies were looking for. I thought that finishing most of a problem would be enough. Or showing that I somewhat understood what the solution might be might get me through. I thought that was all I needed for a company to give me a chance. I was naive. Companies are taking a huge risk whenever they hire a new employee. You need to make sure that the company you are interviewing for will be excited to have you onboard. If you’ve achieved that, then you’ve nailed the interview.
First things first, highlight your strengths. What makes you a strong candidate? What will set you apart? I knew my background in teaching gave me a unique perspective and skill set. Regularly presenting in front of a lot of people allowed me to bring something extra to the table. And I’d much rather speak in front of an unimpressed software engineer over a group of pissed off teenagers any day. I made sure to take advantage of this skill during the interview. It especially became useful when chatting with the CEO of the small company I was interviewing for.
I also had gone above and beyond on a website project I did for my degree program. The requirement was to have a basic HTML page with some JavaScript backing it. I decided to go the extra mile and to dive in and learn Angular and integrate it with my page. I am glad I did that because I got a new, fancy framework on my resume by taking on the extra work. On top of that, I got a great working of example of the shiny UI which was a great show piece. It showed that I was interested in new technologies and applying them to the work I did daily. It was also a great talking point during the interview. It gave me the chance to show that I could learn a new skill in a short amount of time and apply it meaningfully.
You may find that you are stretching your resume to meet the requirements of a job. If you find yourself in this situation, then consider doing some open source work or applying for an internship. Both of these experiences will give you the valuable opportunity to contributed to a larger codebase. It also shows that you can collaborate with other people in a codebase. This is a skill most companies look for when hiring since it is vital for thriving in most modern tech companies.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-k9WhRznHxvUNI-CnTcorA.png']",/@colin.gabriel.smith?source=post_page---byline--16ce13f9d0ce---------------------------------------

Asthe late screenwriting legend William Goldman famously said; “nobody knows anything” so predictions — specially about technology — always run the risk of making people look silly in the not-so-distant-future.
That said, I’m going to go out on a limb and say that in the next few years we’re going to see more people becoming “Virtual Reality Refugees.” By which I mean that immersive technologies will provide increasingly attractive alternatives for those wishing to escape the dreamlike madness that has overtaken our real world.

Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”.
I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results…
Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged.
Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited!
Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites.

Founded in April 2017, ONEROOT is a blockchain technology solution provider focused on the development of underlying technologies. It is committed to building industry infrastructure, breaking the application threshold of blockchain technology and facilitating more external resources to enter the blockchain industry. Over the past year, ONEROOT has successively developed a decentralized transaction protocol R1, a distributed decentralized exchange DDEX, a distributed centralized exchange DCEX, high-performance public chains RNC, a user terminal Touch Wallet and other products, which have won recognition from top international partners in the industry.
Mutual benefits and shared achievements are the consistent concept of ONEROOT, of which the core is fair and efficient transfer of value. RNT is the bridge connecting all links of the ecosystem, and therefore has a solid value base. With the rapid development of the blockchain industry, ONEROOT ecosystem continues to expand. As a result, the service targets have become more diversified, and new application scenarios have been emerging. Meanwhile, the functions and positioning of RNT have also changed. To this end, we have refined the application scenarios, clarified the relationship between supply and demand, and explained the value base of RNT from the function aspect.
Transaction Scenario
Transaction is the most mature application scenario in the blockchain industry and one of the main development directions of ONEROOT. Insufficient liquidity along with high development and maintenance costs is a challenge for all exchange operators. Guided by the concept of mutual benefits and shared achievements, ONEROOT’s trading solutions allow operators holding traffic to quickly deploy distributed exchanges, share transaction data and liquidity, meanwhile, improving transaction efficiency and greatly reducing the cost of R&D and maintenance as well as access to traffic of operators. As DDEX and DCEX bring together more and more exchanges, all participants will win through sharing.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FDvvDBPT447tUBsJWORTQg.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--3c9ce69ef622---------------------------------------

Specifically where things can go wrong in agile and where things can be improved in the process. Before going forward If you haven’t practiced agile you may have a few questions —
There are several implementations of agile, scrum being one of the most popular and one which I have been adopting for the past few years. Something I have noticed that is done by most people (my self included) while following agile, is that they often skip major steps or values that are core to the agile process. And such things result in agile being practiced in very unproductive/counter-productive and frustrating ways for both developers and product owner.
Let’s take the most popular agile implementation — scrum.The basic values essential to scrum are :
Courage could be realized in many different ways. Courage is shown by disagreeing with something the product owner wants (with reason of course). Courage is shown by accepting failure and being honest with the product owner when something does not work out as planned or expected. Courage is shown by saying “NO” to product owner when asked to take more tasks than you can handle. Courage is shown by disagreeing or pointing out flaws to your team or superiors. Courage is also shown by rigorously defending what you believe or know to be true and even more courage is shown by accepting and realizing what you knew, held or believed to be true isactually wrong!
All this may seem like something that is up to an individual, but I think it to be quite different. I believe that ideally in a scrum team all members must create a platform on which members are encouraged to put forward their ideas, thoughts, arguments, and concerns before a team comfortably and without any repercussions. Some members may voice their concerns or thoughts no matter what, as it’s in their nature while others may try to hide behind the ones that do so and simply nod away.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*a6Wy6gsw2RBZ2bBe2KpLYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*a6Wy6gsw2RBZ2bBe2KpLYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*a6Wy6gsw2RBZ2bBe2KpLYA.jpeg']",https://dasithkuruppu.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--27b23ea665f0---------------------------------------

It’s my way to process what I see, organize my thoughts and understand my world. It helps me have a prepared mind when investing and supporting portfolio companies. My predictions for the year are notes to self, as subjective and informed as for the next VC’s opinion. I submit these thoughts so you know me better and somewhat understand what I do. I post these predictions to start the conversation for the year in Latin American tech — plus it’s a fun exercise.
If last year felt confusing sometimes depressing, this year will feel worse. The world will face new challenges under terrible leadership. Absent a violent and unexpected shock, the US will fare well economically but will probably have a year of reckoning dealing with its daemons. Fred Wilson has abold predictionon this. A global bear market coupled with unprecedented volatility will mostly spare the startup economy more vigorous after a rally of IPOs in the first half of the year.
Despite the resilience, global venture capital will appear more scarce due to more cautious investors and global volatility. Investors tend to focus on portfolio allocation and follow-on rounds when going through an economic downturn. One unexpected consequence of US travails may be American tech investors seeking additional diversification outside of the US either by pushing portfolio cos to expand internationally or by investing directly in high growth verticals in promising markets. They will realize Uber IPO premium price on Lyft comes not from US market leadership but from international exposure. Silicon Valley investors that ventured outside of the comfort of the bay area will begin to outperform peers. LPs will take note. I think the massive trend of venture capital globalization as seen below will get stronger this year.
In this context colored by our own national complications, Latin American tech will cement all the progress made during thefantastic 2018. I think total VC investment for this year will miss last year’s mark while the number of deals will go up.
In a nutshell, if nothing terrible happens, 2019 will feel like a long year but one where Latin American tech has a chance to thrive.

And if mismatch is detected in the arbitrary miniscule audit of 1 booth/constituencyECI EVM VVPAT manual July 2018doesn’t even have a direction or clause to do/allow the necessitated full VVPAT audit . ECI has also vehemently opposed several cases by various parties in courts requesting for proper audit. Courts have evaded responsibility by leaving discretion to ECI & has failed to make ECI accountable. Mainstream media have remained silent even on grave issues like mass voter deletion & widespread mismatch in votes counted & polled suggesting EVM error/rigging in elections. In such an environment in which the Elections with EVM VVPAT technology is made unaccountable , the transparent & time tested Paper ballots must be preferred. Use of EVM VVPAT should not be allowed without proper , statistically sound audit & election rule for necessitated full VVPAT tally on mismatch in sample audit. Merely focusing on EVM ban has allowed grave issues of EVM VVPAT use to go unnoticed & unquestioned.
A Voter checks at the time of voting whether the paper record of his vote is correct by verifying the VVPAT printout. The check whether the vote has been correctly recorded by the EVM is done by tallying aka auditing an adequate & statistically sound sample of this VVPAT slips. VVPAT Mismatch means the votes recorded by VVPAT & EVM don’t tally. This is definite evidence of EVM error or EVM rigging. So if any mismatch occurs in the representative sample audited, it suggests that the results by EVM counting in the constituency is wrong & hence a full 100% VVPAT count of all booths of the constituency is essential to find the people’s mandate or result. The most important elements of a valid audit are adequate sample size , transparent & independent randomization & full VVPAT tally on any mismatch.
(Describing more on VVPAT here as most voters & even political party leaders doesn’t seem to have enough info about VVPAT, Significance of proper randomization , Meaning of mismatch & Necessity of full audit on mismatch — This also shows why paper ballots are much preferred. )
ECI currently only allows VVPAT audit of 1 booth /constituency. In most constituencies this comes to about 0.4% of VVPATs used. For example in Gujarat election there were 50128 booths for 182 constituencies. So about 0.36%. aka 182/50128 booths were allowed to be audited there.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*GrbjLd4I5NUq6Nf6mzrupA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*GrbjLd4I5NUq6Nf6mzrupA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*GrbjLd4I5NUq6Nf6mzrupA.jpeg']",/@unnikts?source=post_page---byline--e949f65bc689---------------------------------------

This isn’t a new piece of constructive criticism.Berlin appears to be fond of copying. It can be pretty shameless. Some startups make no attempt to evolve beyond something that already exists. Sure, in business it’s good to benchmark your competition. But what seems to go on in a few places around Berlin isn’t benchmarking, it is straight copying.
I find this sad for a few reasons. Startup employees with genuine creativity who care about providing value to customers and shareholders feel like their internal flame is being slowly extinguished at a clone factory.
It’s also not a good way to mentor young people just entering employment by teaching them that they shouldn’t think for themselves but instead switch-off their robust brains and just copy. What will these workers be like in 10-20 years time when they’ll most likely be needed to use their creative problem solving brains? And demonstrate true leadership skills? This just feels damaging for long-term career development. What happens when Germany’s workforce has a fat layer of mid and senior level managers who are only skilled at copying?
On the other hand, buyers — including German consumers — deserve better than cheap knock-offs being pushed to try and position a startup for a quick high priced acquisition for founder paydays and investor profits.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*7zCyLMucqF3_9XrYZ0jOKA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*7zCyLMucqF3_9XrYZ0jOKA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*7zCyLMucqF3_9XrYZ0jOKA.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--1aacf7ed4c45---------------------------------------

How can the knowledge and skills of an expert be deconstructed into a format that can be understood by a novice, and then built up in a way that transforms the novice into an expert? How to ensure genuine retained understanding, memory, ability and transferrable intelligence? And how to do it at scale?
“This is only possible by combining effective instruction (teaching), cognitive science and neuroscience, and technology (artificial intelligence) — in one solution,” summarizes Guy Riese, Forbes 30 under 30, CEO and CoFounder ofUp Learn. “If you take just one of those you can have a good product. If you take two, it can be great. If you take all three and do it right, you solve education.”
It all started when Riese fell ill at the beginning of his A Levels and missed an entire term. Keen not to move down a year, he searched the internet for ways to catch up and came across research on effective learning in the field of cognitive science. He applied these insights to his studies and rose from below average grades to top of his year in Maths, Chemistry, and Physics. He went on to achieve straight A*s, scoring 100% in Physics and secured a place at Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering. Riese then graduated with 1st Class Honours and a dissertation on Machine Learning.
“The secret to my success, and why some students get A*s, whilst others get Cs and Ds, has not been because ofwhatI’ve learnt, it’s beenhow.” I founded Up Learn to create a system for making the most effective learning experience in the world accessible to all”.
Up Learn is building a product that delivers education success at scale, starting with A Levels. It consolidates thousands of learning resources in one system. The content created by Up Learn teachers is fuelled by research into cognitive science, which ensures its efficiency and efficacy.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Xx0u_tCqtMojNWDn4NElMQ.jpeg']",/@MirunaGirtu?source=post_page---byline--17da5cf5201f---------------------------------------

먼저,1. 배포 후 발견된 버그를 수정할 수 있다는 점,2. DApp이 비즈니스 로직을 업데이트할 수 있다는 점, 두 가지 이유를 통해 스마트 컨트랙트의 ‘Upgradeability(업그레이드 가능성)’의 필요성에 대해논의한 후, Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework가 만족시켜야 할 조건들과 Storage, Function Call 그리고 DelegateCall의배경지식을 살펴보았습니다. 이후, Proxy와 Registry를 이용한 Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework를설명했습니다.
Upgradeable Smart Contract Framework(이하 USCF)을 이용하면, Atomic한 업그레이드와 동일한 Entry point를 통해 DApp 서비스의 질을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 하지만 여전히 서비스 운영에 있어 개발자의 어려움이 남아 있습니다. 업그레이드 가능한 서비스를 운영하기 위해서는 개발자가 USCF에 대한 모든 배경 지식을 알고 있어야 한다는 점입니다. 실제 서비스는 여러 컨트랙트들로 이루어져 있는 경우가 대부분이기 때문에 모든 컨트랙트들과 각 컨트랙트들에 해당하는 Proxy 컨트랙트들을 일일이 관리해야 하며, 배포 단계에서 배포와 업그레이드 함수 호출의 순서를 알고 있어야 합니다.
이러한 프레임워크에 대한 배경지식들은 진입 장벽이 되어 개발 속도를 현저히 떨어뜨립니다. 그렇다면 기존에 존재하던 여러 프레임워크들은 어떤 방식을 취하고 있을까요? 프레임워크는 그들만의 도구가 존재합니다.

Truffle Framework는 자바스크립트 테스트 도구인mocha를 사용하여 스마트 컨트랙트 테스팅 방법론을 제시합니다. 기존에 많이 쓰이는 mocha의 형태를 따라가기 때문에 직관적인 장점이 있지만, 스마트 컨트랙트를 테스팅 하기 위해서는 여러 전처리 작업이 필요합니다. 컴파일, 배포, 블록체인과 연결, 주소 저장 등의 작업은 필수적이지만 매 테스트 시 설정하기에는 상당히 번거롭습니다. 이를 위해, Truffle Framework는truffle cli tool를 함께 제공하여 전처리 작업을 자동화합니다. 사실상 이 도구가 없으면 이 Framework를 사용하기에 많은 제약이 있다고 할 수 있습니다.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*mQAQ9Cds4-OaHJg8j4Ez9Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mjv3JA6-5BsjA_UA4DPOYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mjv3JA6-5BsjA_UA4DPOYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mjv3JA6-5BsjA_UA4DPOYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mQAQ9Cds4-OaHJg8j4Ez9Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mQAQ9Cds4-OaHJg8j4Ez9Q.jpeg']",/@jchoyeclipse?source=post_page---byline--eafb0c4fe25c---------------------------------------

I came to the U.S. from Iran.
I decided to immigrate primarily because I was seeking a better higher education, and Canada and the U.S. is known to have some of the best schools in the world. In addition to education, like many, I chose to immigrate because I wanted to explore opportunities; to unleash my potential where it counts.
As an immigrant, there are many challenges you face. Paperwork processes were one of them, as it was hard to understand what needed to get done and when. However, the number one challenge I faced when I arrived in the U.S. was language. The ability to communicate in words and understand gestures used in daily conversations — you can’t just translate words directly. There’s more to it. All countries have slang and that’s not just something you learn in class or through a podcast. It’s something you learn when engaging with locals. To add to this, understanding the thought process behind the language and gestures; the psychology. Why people say certain things, what people want to hear, etc.
Becoming an entrepreneur wasn’t my first thought, nor was it my second or third. I just always had a passion for building things. Since early childhood, I was building things. I always wanted to be in a competitive space and to do something that challenged me and allowed me to further develop my skills. The harder the task was, the more exciting it became to me. Having said that, I became an entrepreneur as a result of my personal experiences. When I set out to study abroad and immigrate to another country, I faced a long list of obstacles. From obtaining the right information about schools and programs to applying for a visa, it was hard. Through this experience, I recognized there is a huge lack of product and software services in this particular area (EdTech). I took it upon myself to launch something; a technical solution to the problem — To challenge myself.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO']",/@aminerahal613?source=post_page---byline--d13f89ac0a97---------------------------------------

As a kid, I spent my school holidays tagging my “uncles” who drove me around, making deliveries to hotel chains, supermarkets and warehouses. As the new “ah sia kia” (rich guy son) or “towkay kia” (boss’ son) in the office, one of my biggest challenge was to work with the same “uncles” who watched me grew up.
What really amazed me when I first plunged into this Supply Chain industry full-time was literally the tonnes of problems I had to solve. I mean, how hard could it be to move goods from one point to another, right? WRONG! I was fascinated by the complexity behind, yet at many times, simply couldn’t understand many of the “hard rules” that people just follow blindly and comply to. Why can’t we do things in another way that can possibly save us more time and efforts?
In 2013, I made my 2nd crazy decision to start a Container Haulage business, after my first year in the family business. It was (and still is) very common to get this: “Just follow my way of doing things, when Uncle was doing this, you were still drinking milk.” How best to move away from that than getting into an entirely new business unit that even my Dad is not familiar with? Being young and ambitious, I thought, “How hard can it be to move Containers right?” WRONG AGAIN!
I finally understood why my previous contractors were always failing me, why containers are always “On The Way” or that somehow their trucks were either always having a “technical breakdown” or “tyre pangcek” (punctured). It was a challenging job with customers not being able to understand the pains behind your operational incapability.
It was indeed a problematic headache. Despite that, I soldiered on alone, got my hands dirty, spent many sleepless nights alone in my office figuring out how to resolve the countless operational issues with the limited network that I had. I built and scaled the business to a sizeable fleet of 15 trucks within 3 years, and in 2016, I thought I managed to resolve the problem. Not enough truck to service customers,? Just buy more! Invest more! Soon, I began to realize that the larger my business grew, the more problems I had.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*LzkG-9PueTlHgc0W.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*LzkG-9PueTlHgc0W.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*LzkG-9PueTlHgc0W.']",/@alvinea?source=post_page---byline--f312b09f1ce5---------------------------------------

A majority of data come from USA , then Europe and Asia counts for less than 10%. My guess is price difference leads to this location clustering.

But, what if your stereo never had a remote in the first place, or it doesn’t work for your volume control setup?

If you find yourself with one, you canfollow Redditor justikowski’s lead and add a motorized remote volume control mechanism.
justikowski’sstereois used for all of their living room audio needs, but the setup doesn’t have any remote volume control. They couldn’t just purchase a universal remote, because the stereo simply doesn’t have the capability. It might have been possible to hack the stereo itself to add that functionality, but the solution they came up with is easier — and it looks cool as heck.
The solution is to set upan Arduinowith an infrared receiver, and have it spin a stepper motor. A belt loops around the motor’s output and the stereo’s volume knob. The Arduino can be programmed to accept infrared commands from any button on any remote, so it’s easy to use whatever remote you already have on hand. The Arduino and motor are packed into a simple3D-printedenclosure made from black ABS, so it blends in seamlessly with the other devices on the entertainment center.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg']",/@cameroncoward?source=post_page---byline--dedcb275d250---------------------------------------

However, when we decide which cryptocurrencies to list on Luno, one of our requirements is that they have a clear potential for mass adoption and are already showing consistent, long-term market traction. Basically, we need to be sure lots of people want to use them and will keep using them. That means that altcoins we might support have to solve a real problem.
It’s often said that technology adoption follows a bell curve with defined stages as different people start catching on.
It usually begins withinnovators: those on the cutting edge of technology who are in the know about brand new developments. They’re followed byearly adopters, who tend to be young, well-educated and able to take risks before the early majority move in; think hipsters, but less concerned with the price of avo-toast and more concerned with technological advancements. Although slightly more risk-averse, these people are nonetheless open-minded and susceptible to the influence ofearly adopters. Next, come the more scepticallate majority, then the ‘laggards.’
It’s at this point where it’s ubiquitous and usually cheaply available. It’s usually at this point that the real (read: annoying) hipsters scorn said technology in favour of some long-gone nostalgia.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2YTtrzTK52YxYwa3_aRdMg.png']",/@LunoGlobal?source=post_page---byline--860924d3bd2f---------------------------------------

OUR ECONOMY IN MOTION
Catalysed by the rise of automation, a new economic era is emerging. In the past, we have given names to economies based on the main skills or attributes needed to sustain economic growth. For example, the Industrial Age was mainly sustained by machines and more recently the Knowledge Economy was powered by the use of human knowledge to create technology and new systems. Now with disruptive technologies on the rise, we are questioning the role of the human in the workforce, furthermore how industry will need to shift for humans to thrive in this emergent economy — the Human led Economy.

Since this isTHE FIRSTI think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am, why I decided to start blogging, what you can expect from my blog, and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”.
I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised), but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreadedJOB SEARCHafter. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies, sending out hundreds of resumes, and it always ended with similar if not the same results…
Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day, I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey, they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in, and what did I have to lose? Luckily, the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged.
Ummm, YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited!
Ok, let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum, which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me, that they were rooting for me, and hadNEVERmet me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you onFULL-TIMEas a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms, it’s been featured in different tech newsletters, and shared on other websites. You can read the articleHERE.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*IHg8ZGXaxJcwqEyj1GRJ8w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5XeEneUuVNVEpRJtmt7tMA.jpeg']",/@brittney.ball07?source=post_page---byline--83ed88c0b267---------------------------------------

Drivably, the first ever machine learning platform to source, qualify, predict, and provide the right inventory for your dealership in real time.
With the ability to increase profitability, and efficiently scale your internal buying channels, dealerships will time travel right back into the hay day when they actually made money on cars.
Drivably analyzes millions of data points across platforms like Kelly Blue Book, NADA, Manheim, and others to under to understand what inventory belong in what markets across the US. This gives dealerships the ability to make the right decisions on what to purchase, every time.
If you ask 10 “Car Dog” dealers if they made better margins on selling cars in 1998 than 2018, 10 of them will say some variation of “ABSOLUTELY”. The acquisition epidemic that dealers are being faced with today comes down to four things.
With Drivably, dealers will now have access to new rental, fleet, and private inventory that is designed to meet their needs. Because of Drivably’s extensive relationships across these various channels, they are able to analyze hundreds of thousands of units every single day. Drivably can tell dealerships what inventory they need, regardless of where is sits in the US and due to their friendly approach to the private market, they have the ability to tap into 15 million private market units that most dealers don’t currently have access to.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*83HE1GVbtB4uwnGxaoW8XQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*83HE1GVbtB4uwnGxaoW8XQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*83HE1GVbtB4uwnGxaoW8XQ.jpeg']",/@tylerchristianhall?source=post_page---byline--a5aa5c0fb2a9---------------------------------------

Every iPhone gesture means something about your user: whether they know where to tap and how to navigate, what features they’re interested in, and what frustrates them. If you could see and understand these interactions, you’d know exactly how to make your app better and which UI elements need improvement. That’s wheretouch heatmapscome in.
Touch heatmaps are the mobile industry’s standard for assessing UI and the usability of iPhone gestures. They allow mobile teams to gain an in-depth understanding of user behavior at a glance: what areas users interact with most, what UI elements catch their attention first, and what causes them to quit or abandon the app. InGartner’s recent Market Guide for Web and Mobile App Analytics, they are called a “struggle detection tool”.
How do mobile touch heatmaps work?
Touch heatmaps collect, measure, and aggregate every touch interaction users made on each screen of the app. Then, this aggregation is displayed on each screen in the form of a visual overlay of a gradient. Areas colored in blue represent areas with low user interaction, and areas colored in red show a high level of user interaction.
Here are five ways to use touch heatmaps to improve your mobile app’s iPhone gestures.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*DagI5pI0VCpup1k7MwDSWQ.png']",/@Appseecom?source=post_page---byline--8a2bb215a25e---------------------------------------

Cook', 'No responses yet']",,2 min read,Jeremy S. Cook,"While you may or may not need to wind thread on a regular basis, this hack by Mr. Innovative will show you how it can be done automatically. The device uses a motor to turn a 3D-printed spool at high speed, pulling thread from a much larger spool positioned vertically at the other end of the assembly. To keep things threaded evenly, a feeding arm is rotated back and forth using a servo.
As the thread travels through the assembly, it spins an encoder disk that allows it to sense just how much thread is applied to the smaller roller. AnArduino Unois used for controlling the machine, along with a custom PCB shield. User interface is provided by a small OLED display that shows thread length, as well as a rotary encoder with a pushbutton input. The device features a manual winding mode, plus a mode that enables it to wind a predefined length of thread.

https://medium.com/@riccardo.dawson/here-we-are-yourkeys-dc6568dc49d0?source=tag_archive---------60-----------------------,Here we are — Yourkeys,"['Written by Riccardo Dawson', 'No responses yet']",,4 min read,Riccardo Dawson,"So it’s the second day of 2019, we’ve launched the company, it’s the only thing that I’ve thought about for the last few years and it finally happened, in September last year we went live with our soft launch after nearly 12 months of 5 am starts and long nights. The day we ended for Christmas, we saw the first transaction through the platform — an awesome feeling and a great achievement.
So, why are we doing what we’re doing? Why — we believe that buying your new home should be easy, transparent and fun. That is why I started making my way down this path in the first place.
So, let’s start from the beginning. As a result of my training as an architect, I’ve always had an eye for design and detail, I’m the kind of guy that walks down the street and notices that the detailing on a building is asymmetrical and then proceeds to tell all his friends about it (yep, I’m a riot at parties!). So when I joined Shape Real Estate as Sales and Marketing Director at 24, in hindsight, a role I was massively under-qualified for, my naive, wide-eyed self wanted to make an impression, and an impression I made. Having come from a world of design, I believed that through good story-telling you could sell anything, even £1m+ apartments. I convinced the board that if we doubled the marketing budget, I could create a narrative around the building which would lead them to sell more quickly and therefore recoup the overspend. I did things very differently to normal marketing campaigns — I created the first ‘pop-up’ marketing suite in Piccadilly Circus station, put on a street party and created various guerilla campaigns. We improved sales, but not enough to justify the overspend. The market stagnated and buyers couldn’t have cared less about the story they just wanted to buy a place and get through the process unscathed — I was definitely not the employee of the month.
So, why am I telling you this? I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit. Entrepreneurs look for broken things that matter to people. Holes in the fabric of life that could be patched with ingenuity and a bit of effort to make life easier for everyone. So after the confidence knock I took from the marketing budget escapade, I was back on my feet and back looking for broken things to fix.
One thing I did notice when dealing with all of these property transactions was the fear and confusion in the eyes of the buyers, as they approached such a milestone in their lives. A young couple hand-in-hand walking towards the marketing suite with a smile from ear to ear, only for the happiness to drain from their faces when they are told: “now, you need a conveyancer, an AIP, searches need to be done, enquiries made, exchange contracts and don’t forget insurance, oh, and you have 28 days to get it done, bye!” I realised there that must be a better way.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*F1z0DaO4aM6DZtSr']",/@riccardo.dawson?source=post_page---byline--dc6568dc49d0---------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence. The term has become ubiquitous in this digital age. Highly complex, opaque yet celebrated. We are grateful for the ease it brings through recommendation engines on retail, music and streaming platforms. Nevertheless, overwhelming choices have led us to trade in our purchasing behaviour and transaction data for an algorithm that simply reinforces our own tastes of the past.
What is “taste?”
How is it possible thatthe world’s most valuable companybuilt an empire reimagining appearance of an ancient consumer-electronics industry, receive as many praises as criticism for their “timeless design?”
Through a philosophical lens, natural taste is “not a theoretical knowledge; it is a quick and exquisite application of rules which we do not even know.” The unknowingness of whether something is tasteful to us cannot be measured or captured by a singular algorithm.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*21qQvcThuZbk5oplBmZlvg@2x.jpeg']",/@dianehuang?source=post_page---byline--c91c2fe4d1f1---------------------------------------

The best shot we have of programming the SI’s goals to avoid total existential catastrophe is to achieve international cooperation in SI development and then tell the SI to “achieve that which we would have wished the SI to achieve if we had thought long and hard.”
I find this conclusion (and the entire book, really) to be quite terrifying. And, that was clearly Bostrom’s desired effect — to convince readers that the advance of artificial intelligence is an epically important topic that should be invested in and carefully studied. Bostrom is not shying away from fear mongering when he writes:
As the first phase of my response toSuperintelligence, I’d like to run through all the ways that Bostrom successfully freaked me out.
First, that “failure” meansirreversible existential catastrophe; as Bostrom puts it, we only experience an existential catastrophe zero or one times. Second, that we can fail in so many different ways — we can fail if the SI developers are evil, self-interested, or plain old ignorant. And the people who first develop SI will likely be the only developers of SI because the exponential rate of improvement after the crossover point means that the first SI that is developed will achieve a “decisive strategic advantage” over other projects. Really, we can fail insomanyways — in part 1 of this post, I listed a tiny portion of the dystopic possible outcomes that Bostrom lays out.
The third thing that freaks me out is the general uncertainty surrounding this whole endeavor. Bostrom uses the qualifier, “assuming we aren’t totally oblivious to ___,” concerningly often. Bostrom’s vision of global cooperation seems highly uncertain when we consider the difficulty of reaching global agreements which limit an individual country’s military or economic strength. Also, the whole idea of telling the SI to do “that which we would have asked it to do if we had thought long and hard” is uncertainby design— it would mean creating an all-powerful entity with an unknown end-goal. The AI theorist, Eliezer Yudkowsky, calls this strategy Collective Extrapolated Volition (CEV) and describes it as:","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page---byline--6b9cbeddbd54---------------------------------------

Cook'],1,2 min read,Jeremy S. Cook,"Pipes deteriorate deteriorate and may need to be inspected. Fortunately, robots are available for this job, meaning humans don’t always have to be directly involved in this labor intensive and even dangerous task. These robots, however, are extremely expensive.This project aims to constructan alternative to those that are on the market, with a structure that can adapt to pipes of various diameters.
The robot that the team came up with uses a pair of three-wheel roller assemblies arranged at 120 degrees for contact along the pipe’s inner diameter. Each wheel is attached to a linkage assembly that connects it to a central spring, designed to contract and expand as necessary to maintain pressure on the pipe, even if the diameter changes. For locomotion, two of the three front wheels are driven by powerful gear motors, pulling the rest of the robot with it. Control is accomplished via anArduino Unoand an L298N H-bridge board.
As of now, it’s been shown to work well 300mm and 320mm horizontal pipes, and can roll like a car through larger diameters as well. One could see this type of design expanded in the future with three- or six-wheel drive and perhaps active control of the wheel linkages. This could then allow for better maneuverability or use in vertical piping.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg']",/@JeremySCook?source=post_page---byline--57d2645edb8---------------------------------------

2018년 초에 저희 팀 멤버들은 권위 있는 컨퍼런스인PEER Summit에 초청받았습니다. Luna Stars (LSTR) 토큰 관련 스마트 계약과 세일즈 플랫폼 코드를 마무리하고 초안을 제작하는 시간을 가졌습니다. 2월 1일에는 Luna 최소 실행 상품을 출시하고 LSTR 공매를 시작하였습니다. 토큰 판매와 관련된 다양한 기사를 보시려면여기를 클릭하세요.
저희 팀은 지리적으로 분산된 협업의 형태로 시작하였습니다. 상품 관리와 디자인 팀은 공매 후 뉴욕으로 옮겼고, 엔지니어링 팀은 세계 곳곳으로 나뉘어졌습니다. 본 엔지니어링 팀은 이백서에 소개된 Luna web앱을 개선하는 데에 주력했습니다. 더 자세한 내용은여기를 참조하세요.
저희는 여러 시간대에 있는 사람들이 함께 일을 할 때에 발생하는 문제들과 맞닥뜨렸습니다. 그래서 다음 단계에서는 핵심 기능 개발을 위해 한 장소에서 함께 일하는 것의 장점에 대해 더 생각해 보게 되었습니다. 고심 끝에 저희는 독일 베를린에 사무실을 열게 되었습니다 (자세한 내용은 아래를 참고하세요). 원격 개발자들의 도움을 받아 같은 시간대에서 일할 수 있는 현장에서 저희는 재능 있는 인재를 모집했습니다. 베를린에서 저희는 한 발 더 나아가서엔지니어링 매니저와 행정 보조를 채용하였으며,유럽 기반의 소프트웨어 개발 회사와도 계약을 체결하였습니다. 새로 꾸려진 엔지니어링 팀은 순차적으로 데이팅 앱 최소 실행 상품의 업데이트(v0.2,v0.3)를 출시하였습니다. 또한, 상품 출시와 함께 전송 속도와 상품의 구상을 전반적으로 개선하기 위해 다양한 인재 채용을 계속하였습니다.
Luna 데이팅 앱 모델이 현존하는 데이팅 앱들의 어긋난 인센티브를 해결하고 균형을 맞추는 데에 성공했지만 앱 개발을 진행 하면서 저희 모델의 부작용을 발견하게 되었습니다. 전형적인 매칭 알고리즘의 낮은 한계점에 의해 제한된 모델이라는 점을 발견하였는데 이를 해결하기 위해 베를린과 뉴욕 팀 간의 브레인스토밍이 제품 연구에 중요한 부분을 차지하게 되었습니다. 더 나아가 저희가 세운 몇 가지 가정을 검증하기 위하여 ‘빠른 실패와 더욱 빠른 성공’을 모델로 하여 단시간에 유저 기반 실험을 진행하였습니다. 단기적인 테스트를 진행함으로써 여러 모델의 장기적 유효성을 알아보고 빠른 개선이 이루어 질 수 있도록 했습니다. 이 접근 방식은 곧 최종 결과가 미리 정해지지 않는다는 것을 의미합니다. 역으로, 저희가 사용자들에게 창출해낼 수 있는 가치에 기반한 결과라는 것을 뜻하지요.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Y7qXR-kmZjSSPoqUahllVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*5P-pdPAPS5Q58Goz.']",/@lunalabs?source=post_page---byline--c99aaa71e99c---------------------------------------

The intended goal is to describe this window, which is covered by drapes of ignorance and conditioning, these drapes can be opened by process of Yoga and then light of transcendental knowledge and spiritual bliss shines through.
The ‘spiritual technology’ was at it’s peak few thousand years back. It was highly developed and prevalent in practice. It was called ‘Yoga’ because it culminated the entire lifestyle of an Vedic society. Yoga means union of everything. Hence Yoga is the process, which defines and inculcates, every action a person (a Yogi) performs both individually and collectively as a member of an elite Yogic society.
Using this spiritual technology humans had created a pristine civilization which lived in complete harmony with nature. Everyone had abundance of satisfaction and happiness. The technology in itself was sufficient in providing a long fulfilling and healthy life. It tapped into fulfilling the real needs of all living beings. It extracted from human beings their inherent sense of goodness and morality, via practical actions that suited the circumstances of their particular time and place.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*FdNNqEIAHcz9hsv2mMZUhQ.jpeg']",/@mayank.agrawal84?source=post_page---byline--ecac7dbbe1b---------------------------------------

I never waited for or had a sense of entitlement that my employer should pay for them. Over the past 16 years I have earned an alphabet soup of certifications including PMP, ITIL, CSM, CSPO, CSP, and SPC. Only the ITIL foundation certification was sponsored by a former employer, as they were offering it to all of their IT staff.
At specific strategic points in my career I have leveraged my certifications to land key jobs that furthered my career. So, I certainly understand that certifications can help a candidate land a job.
With so many candidates applying for positions, often a specific certification on a resume can make the difference between an application being considered or rejected based on specific filters. This can be especially important in certain technology areas where a very challenging certification demonstrates extensive knowledge and experience. Some great examples include the CISSP security certification and the CBAP certification for business analysts.
While certifications can play a role in getting considered for a job, many of them demonstrate little more than initiative. For example, consider the two first-level Agile certifications offered by Scrum Alliance: Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). The CSM is obtained by attending a two-day course (by a Certified Scrum Trainer) and then passing an easy 40-question test. The CSPO is even easier. It is obtained merely by attending a two-day course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer.
Don’t get me wrong. I took both of these courses and they were valuable to me. I have used material from each course, taught by very experienced and respected trainers, in subsequent roles as an Agile practitioner.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*qtIYwR5X37BvW0oT_DwurA@2x.jpeg']",https://rich-sevawise.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--279975c8630b---------------------------------------

Canada, from Montreal.
Adjusting from having a recession mentality to an abundance-driven one. I left Quebec which was going through a deep recession that lasted many years and so you had to take whatever job you could find — today that is no longer the case but there were no jobs when I was growing up. In the U.S., you could be more ambitious and more creative if you set your mind to it, but it required shifting to an abundance mentality that allowed you to dream.
Outside of college where I had a variety of jobs, I worked at the human rights organization,WITNESS.org, because I wanted to fuse documentary filmmaking and human rights work. This was at a time when YouTube didn’t yet exist (nor did digital cameras). WITNESS was the first group to envision the ubiquitous presence of cameras, and their potential for social transformation if held by human rights defenders. Peter Gabriel, the musician, conceived of the idea while traveling to South Africa in the 1980s. I joined in 2000 and got hooked on the role that media and technology could play in effecting change.
It wasn’t a conscious choice at first — I would see a gap, look around to see who was filling it, and if there was someone doing so effectively in ways that interested me professionally or creatively or ethically I would join them (in the case of WITNESS, my first job), and if there wasn’t, I’d endeavor to do so directly. That happened both with my first organization, Just Vision, and again with my company, Localized.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO']",/@aminerahal613?source=post_page---byline--e27a27d9512b---------------------------------------

When I was 4 my grandmother bought me VHS tapes of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos (dubbed in Spanish). Back then I believed him when he said “…The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.” As I grew older, however, my dreams became more like holograms, visible, yet never truly in reach.
Throughout high school my grades slowly declined as I began having terrible panic attacks. I would hide my face in my books, in a primordial cycle of fight or flight with no danger present. It became exhausting and some days I opted to not go to school at all. I distanced myself from my friends and became less and less sure of whether I had a future worth pursuing.
I worked in a deli and regardless of how polite or how disciplined I was, I would always be treated as almost a competent human being. I had a boss snap his fingers at me, and while most customers were a delight some customers called me boy or asked “where are youfrom?” knowing they didn’t want to know which street I lived on.
My mother and father came from harsher backgrounds than me, yet they seemed to have turned out fine, My mother went from the ghettos to becoming a Navy veteran who graduated 2nd in her class in Airmen school, and my father went from the ghettos to owning his own house at 21. Me, I hadn’t even graduated college yet and couldn’t even seem to be able to go a few days without panic attacks or feelings of depression.
The day my life would change was after a particularly rough attack. I was hiding under my pillow, shaking, the room moving around me. Tears rolling down my cheeks. I looked at the first texts I had sent to the woman I would later make my wife. I told her that I promised her a life of adventure, excitement, and new experiences all the time. I had let her down. But I didn’t feel my usual indifference and sadness. Instead I felt anger. Angry that I always had to decline going to parties with too many people or where there wasn’t an adequate exit strategy. Quitting sports because of dizziness. No.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*39TwOUBZSa-i2bYk3dhskw.jpeg']",/@josephsantos.edu?source=post_page---byline--9187f27dd096---------------------------------------

The real purpose of any diet is to give the practitioner a program to help them achieve balance and harmony in their life. A diet is so much more than what foods we put into our bodies it also encompasses the quality of information that we feed our mind.
My Cuban Abuelita used to tell me and my sisters as children that we were either too “flacko” or “gordo.” Life is full of ups and downs like our weight. We will experience highs and low as we follow our programs and work to achieve our goals in 2019, but the determination to pick ourselves up when we fall is essential for achieving success.
My goal in 2019 is to remain moderate in my use of social media and to start socially conscious businesses that as Marc Benioff says, create a positive impact in the world.
In early 2016 and after much internal debate, I decided to delete my Facebook account and have never looked back. Deleting Facebook, while extreme, did not cause me to become a complete technology recluse but provided a significant social media creative constraint and enabled me to be more conscious and intentional with how I use platforms likeInstagram,LinkedIn,Twitter,Yelp, and others. Quitting all social media for good is an extreme and unbalanced action. It is much better to learn how to practice moderation in our use of social media as it is a more sustainable path.
We are living during the most significant technological revolution in human memory. Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed by a small group of very smart professions are affecting the lives of billions of people around the world. I believe that it is time for more voices from underrepresented groups in technology to be heard. For example, when I was writing the word ‘gordo’ on my iPhone, the Google Keyboard app autocorrected the word to Gordon. I don’t know anyone named Gordon in my community so why would Google AI leaders think ‘gordo’ was a typo for ‘Gordon’ if it wasn’t because for their algorithms are written by a group of mostly white men.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*zmVei2N8q60j8f2FZ5aUFw.jpeg']",https://coreycoto.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--818fcf7df4e1---------------------------------------

That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the tangly mess that is the Sony MDR-7506 headphones, or take to take arms against a sea of aural self-indulgence, and by opposing, ditch the cans.
If you’re new to voice over, you may have to get used to hearing yourself through headphones as you speak. This is tricky for some. It will often make beginners slow down and lose their natural talking rhythm; they’ll read in a one-word-at-a-time fashion, rather than read ahead and speak in phrases.
Why doesn’t this happen to all voice actors who wear headphones? Their ear is above average. Not the cartilagey parts on the outside, best demonstrated by Alfred E. Newman. I’m talking about the intricate, delicate, hairy parts on the inside.
People who master the art of voiceover have “a good ear” above all else.
My first agent in Los Angeles was Steve Tisherman. A genius in many respects, he was the agent who developed and subsequently managed the talents of voiceover titan Don LaFontaine. You may remember Don’s gravelly voice serving up the words“In a World”a few thousand times in the 90s and 2000s, yes? Steve Tisherman said to me in our very first meeting, “You want to whisper your way to million bucks? It’s not voiceover. It’s earover.”Earover? That’s not very catchy, Steve. But, what can I say, I was 29 at the time and had no idea what the hell this Hollywood agent was saying to me. Who did he think he was talking to!? I was anactor.I had MFA training! I’d completed Arthur Lessac’s Kinesensic Training for the voice! I played Hamlet at Cambridge! (Or rather, Marc Antony at Chicago Shakepeare!)

What used to be a process relegated for matchmakers, mixers, and clubs everywhere is now harnessed in the internet’s potential. No longer do you have to leave your home to find somebody special — you can scroll through an online marketplace of people on your phone, tablet or computer.One of my previous articles dictated how this has changed the dating game…

December was a remarkably light news month, but our wonderful media outlets came to the rescue by Frankensteining together a batch of “2018 recap” articles, most of which exclaimed that autonomous tech had faltered during the past year by highlighting the death of Elaine Herzberg and then tossing in some garbage material as filler.

Bostrom asserts that these are inevitable facts; in this piece, I’m going to counter his determinism first with theory and then with real-world examples. Here it goes.
Bostrom argues that it would be impossible to halt SI development because its incredible power will make it irresistible. Bostrom takes a deterministic standpoint in terms of technological development, in a similar way toJacques Ellul, a French philosopher and sociologist. InThe Technological Society, Ellul describes the deterministic adoption of new technologies by saying that individuals and states — in order to avoid being crushed or outcompeted by technological advance — must align themselves with it:
This mechanism removes freedom of choice from individuals as well as from politicians and entire states. In this way, all individuals and institutions are roped into furthering technological advance and efficiency. For example, while self-driving cars will put millions out of work, the fact that some country would inevitably develop them (and if another country does it before the US, we will lose even more jobs and market share) propelledPresident Obama to propose spending $4 billion on research into self-driving cars. On an individual level, I spent years arguing the merits of the flip-phone and railing against the smartphone, and then I (like a classic technical slave) jumped on the smartphone train in order to compete for a promotion at work.
We can see the mechanism Ellul describes all around us. But does that mean that it is inescapable? For Ellul, it is — he is a libertarian purist and believes that any type of collective action is a part of “technical slavery” and is unacceptable because it reduces his “freedom.” But in the face of a technology (SI) that wouldliterallyremove all decision-making power from all ofhumanity(and potentially end in existential catastrophe), we must set purism aside. We must accept the reduction of certain types of freedoms to avoid the ultimate reduction in human freedom! Now that we’ve decided it is okay to use collective organizing to control deployment of dangerous technologies, we can point to a few positive examples of this in human history: biological and nuclear weapons.
The use of biological weapons was first regulated by the Geneva Protocol, which was later supplemented by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) — to which 178 states have signed on (as of December 2016). The US enacted the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act in 1989, which applies the convention to private citizens and criminalizes violations of the convention. Onemajorflaw with the BWC is that it lacks any formal method for monitoring compliance; it instead asks for voluntary annual reports. Negotiations towards an internationally binding monitoring system took place between 1995 and 2001, ending when the Bush administration decided that the US could not be bothered by such silly things as international agreements to prevent mass human suffering…","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page---byline--4b0e1b9cf9dc---------------------------------------

On one hand, you have the claims that by solution providers that jobs are not being lost, while other industry commentators claim that the benefits cannot be achieved without loss of jobs. What is the truth of the situation? Can they both be correct?
Is it possible both scenarios are actually correct and not entirely contradictory?
Let’s start with the optimistic view that automation simply eliminates the mundane tasks and provides the opportunity for more creative, complex and challenging new opportunities. This is explicitly describing that the nature of work will be changing. This is nothing new, in my experience, the advances in technology have been changing my job throughout my entire career.
Furthermore, both in the USA and UK the current levels of unemployment are at the lowest we’ve seen for decades. Japan faces an even more challenging situation where the population is in decline and therefore even filling existing roles as workers retire is an impossible task.
At this early stage of development, the evidence points to RPA not having a significant impact on job losses. That’s not to say there are no winners and losers in this equation, as some industries clearly find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on cutting costs; staff and buildings being the top two savings opportunities.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*o77uCfTREbt6qDVoACFigw.png']",https://medium.com/@WizardRob?source=post_page---byline--77ffb21df08f---------------------------------------

This is an abysmal statistic, but it doesn’t surprise me given the many I’ve personally seen — many of which are purely operational or organizational.

Although many issues associated with IoT deployments aren’t technological, they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. And if every organization has to overcome these challenges in a void, a 74 percent failure rate is likely to continue.

Such innovation makes an organization more competitive and more efficient, often translating to more success and bigger profits, or in other cases — survival. Investing in those ideas comes at a cost, of course, including the risk that failure could leave you in a worse position than had you done nothing at all.
Fortunately, advances in technology aimed at empowering business users have fundamentally redefined what’s achievable and, at the same time, has improved the probability weighted outcomes of business improvement initiatives. As a result, the assumptions that business leaders have traditionally used to calculate the costs of innovation — whether “back-of-the-napkin” or comprehensive models — are no longer valid. In fact, I contend that the “risk” of innovation has never been lower.
When business leaders have evaluated “innovation” opportunities for things such as process improvement, deeper customer engagement, or enhanced decisioning, they’ve generally considered six factors:
But by reducing three key factors — cost, time, and resources required — business user driven work management technologies can also minimize the risk of outright failure. That means business leaders should recalibrate their assumptions about technology-based investment decisions, by increasing the probability of success. Higher probabilities combined with higher throughput of projects executed upon, can result in superior overall returns.

Yes it is. Same specs higher price? Yes it is. But there are reasons for it. When you buy Apple product, let’s say iPhone, you don’t only buy iPhone. There are more to it.
I make software in my daily life, and of course I get paid by my clients for it. But who pay for the iOS, macOS, and every software Apple makes? Unlike android phone manufacturers, who get their software freely from Google, Apple has to do it’s own R&D (Research and Development) and maintenance for its software. And yes it is very costly. According to appleinsider.com, in Q3 2018 Apple has spent $3.7 billion for R&D.
So who pay for it? The answer is, Apple users do! Think about this, the price for every Apple products are including the software inside it. So if you buy an iPhone for lets say $800, maybe $200 in it is the software, and the phone without the software is only $600. That’s why you can’t find other phone using iOS, because they are selling the software too.
Not only the software inside the phone. You buy the maintenance and updates for those software too. Lets take iPad 2 which came out in 2011 and got its last iOS update at 2016. If you bought iPad 2 by 2011, you got update for 5 years without having to pay anything more. It’s like a subscription for 5 years that you pay in front.

After completing an Analytics fellowship last summer, I joined the citywideAnalytics Teamas a full-time data and performance analyst.
My fellowship gave me an inside perspective on what it takes to move a large data project forward and develop strong working relationships in the context of local government.
Thinking of applying? In case you’re on the fence, here are my thoughts on what a summer at DoIT can offer.
As a DoIT fellow, you will be stationed at the heart of timely, impactful work (not to mention the heart of Boston). During my fellowship, I worked with theBoston Public Health Commission (BPHC)to expand healthcare access in the City. Together, we built a web-based app to guide health insurance applicants through the enrollment process. At DoIT, you can grow as a data analyst without sacrificing your penchant for civic engagement.
DoIT fellowships are structured with your development in mind. A personal mentor will help you scope and execute a long-term project based on your personal interests. My mentor brought valuable experience in both data science and project management to my fellowship. She was — unwaveringly — in my corner, whether that meant proofreading an email, troubleshooting over coffee, or simply sharing stories of her own experience as a public servant. This summer, skip the busy work.

The biggest question on the lips of every crypto investor is, “when is this crypto bull run coming?” In such a hugely manipulated market, retail investors have been absolutely decimated, seeing their investments shrinking from the word go and some people have never, not once, seen any upside to their crypto investments. This tale is very common and is very well known to the smart money, who know exactly how and when to apply pressure on the market to extract all the dumb money from emotional, inexperienced investors. Think of it as a see saw, when a market is going up, the smart money is in, when a market is going down, its because the smart money are liquidating its positions, but the point is, the smart money is always on the right side of the trade, so the aim is to be on the right side of the trade with them.
A huge bull run in the crypto market is just around the corner, all of the foundations are being laid and the deals are being done with very little media attention as the elite allow the crypto mania to die down while getting ready to open their positions at their preferred prices. One thing is for certain, everything happening in the market is planned by the elite, there are groups of individuals who know exactly where the market is heading, and these are the guys who have had their money in one of the longest bull runs in stock market history, eventually a lot of this money will flood into crypto and kick off one of the biggest, quickest bull runs you’ve ever seen, likely followed by a huge correction even worse than what we are seeing now.
In order to distinguish a directional bias in the short term, there is a noticeable inverse correlation with Bitcoin and the US Dollar. The Dollar Index is an average, based on a basket of major currencies and indicates the overall strength of the dollar. So when the Dollar Index is in a bear trend, Bitcoin is bullish and visa versa.
From the 10th April 2017 the Dollar Index fell for a total of 287 days from 101.00 to 89.00 before consolidating then reversing. In the exact same period Bitcoin rose from $1200 to $20,000 before reversing at this level.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*q6W9u2pZhf_fSnPRcptgmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*q6W9u2pZhf_fSnPRcptgmg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*q6W9u2pZhf_fSnPRcptgmg.png']",/@dpg.kjg?source=post_page---byline--347065e9966c---------------------------------------

In Symfony applications, you cangive route placeholders a default valueso they can be omitted from the generated URL. Consider this route definition:
If you don’t provide the value of thepagevariable when generating the URL for theblog_listroute, the resulting URL will be/blogand the value of thepageplaceholder will be1:
Although this is the desired behavior in most applications, sometimes you may prefer to always include the value of the placeholder, even when you don’t provide it while generating the URL. In Symfony 4.3 we made this possible with a new syntax for route placeholders:
The!character before the placeholder name tells Symfony to always include its value in the generated URL, no matter if it's a default value:","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*hGeaEYKiMjpT_Qzm.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*hGeaEYKiMjpT_Qzm.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*hGeaEYKiMjpT_Qzm.png']",/@symfony?source=post_page---byline--2511ff6575ef---------------------------------------

With technology, there are constant disruptions that if you do not pay attention to, you will quickly fall behind the disruption curve. One of the largest disruptions we have seen in recent years is the explosion of containers especially Kubernetes. If you are not aware of containers in 2019, you are definitely behind many in the technology field.
How does a senior technical leader get deep enough to know the benefits of such a technology and when to apply them is a constant theme in my career. I decided in 2018 to shift gears in terms of my focus and spend more effort writing code during the year and not wait for the holidays. I wanted to focus on leveraging the latest technologies with the goal of expanding my knowledge base and to remain relevant in today’s economy. While I always considered myself apprised of the latest tech trends and could articulate the benefits of technology choices and architectures pretty well, I felt that I could do more.

The team at Draup has been trying to solve the problem of stateful deletion/updation at the ORM level for Django. Whilst solving the problem, we also wanted to build a generic solution for ORM, so it could be used by Django-developers as well.
Stateful deletion is when an object cannot be directly deleted, without a prior prompt message (when deleting a single object entity, the prompt message gesticulates all the other dependent objects tagged along with the parent entity, before deleting it).
Stateful updation occurs while transferring object dependencies from one object entity to another object entity, through which duplicate entries from database-tables can be erased.

We make them all the time, often without thinking twice. As designers, we arm ourselves with all kinds of tools, techniques, and methodologies aimed at clearing the path of assumption so we can design for users, and not for ourselves. Still, assumptions are always out there, creeping in around the edges waiting for the right moment to slide in and cloud our judgment.
Sometimes assumptions can be expensive. And there’s nothing like an assumption blowing up in your face to make you think twice about taking action without first having all the facts.
Last month I made an assumption based on good-natured intentions that ended up costing $500, some strained relationships, and 100 pounds of spoiled meat. Allow me to explain.
I live in the mountains where I rent a small carriage house above my landlord’s garage. I get to drink my morning coffee on a porch that sits at 7,500 feet and looks out at snow-capped peaks and miles of pine forest. Humblebrag aside, it is by far the most amazing place I have ever lived, and I’m super grateful that I get to call it home.
Because of this, I have a lot of respect for the house, the property, and am in great standing with the landlord. So when he went out of town on a 10-day hunting trip this summer and left the light to one of the property’s outbuildings on, it only made sense to do the good-neighborly thing and shut the door — which was ajar — and turn off the light. Iassumedthat he had been working in the outbuilding during the day with the light on, and had forgotten to turn it off.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KN6DJcBQdJvxQSmi-R8tRg.jpeg']",/@levihpatton?source=post_page---byline--69978454b804---------------------------------------

Shipping Lines, Forwarders, Terminal Operators, etc have salivated at the possibility of having such a predictable and efficient network, where import containers can go directly to the nearest exporter’s place without having to go to empty yards, where significant time is lost in finding the next trip.
Now, with improving visibility and formal data collection finally taking place in the segment, this dream is getting closer to becoming a reality. Containers going from an importer’s chemical factory to an exporter’s FMCG plant while getting cleared by a relayed container surveyor is becoming a reality!
The, march towards this future is beginning with players trying to conquer certain clusters where they have visibility and control. So, during this early adopter stage, the various stakeholders are all entering the realm in different methods vying for the same outcome: an expansion in the space where they can directly cater to the freight owners, by connecting imports and exports in a single direct chain.
In a country where more than 85% of long-haul freight moves by road transportation, the natural 1st layer elongation into the extended logistics segment is road logistics. These days’ road logistics is shifting towards efficient road optimization, where the truck can be optimized, while meeting predicted schedules.
Thus the various stakeholders’ are looking to build their own lane cluster’s on routes they are familiar with, where they have a strong network and operational control. Operational control and a logistics network are the keys to operating a successful end to end logistics program, where additional cargo can be handled without significantly increasing costs.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*9Hr7cu1nnPNkWbCdo5-ZYg.jpeg']",https://shorjoe.medium.com/?source=post_page---byline--1ac9cd16cbdb---------------------------------------

During my years in high-school I had one of the coolest jobs a teenager could have, I worked part-time at the local magic shop. The shop was more than just a shop. It was a workshop where magic tricks and larger stage illusions were created and sold to professionals.
While I loved and still love magic, my journey lied in technology.
Recently, I had the pleasure to combine my two loves. A quick search on YouTube revealed tricks using mobile phones, but I didn’t find any using a smart watch. I knew that the idea of using a less assuming device such as a watch could potentially create a more compelling effect.
I decided to create a magic trick anyone could perform using their Samsung smart watch. Why the Samsung watch? Because it’s the one I own and one that allowed me to combine my other love for web-stack technologies.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*BZSVzezWGU7dOaciAUWA_w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*BZSVzezWGU7dOaciAUWA_w.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*BZSVzezWGU7dOaciAUWA_w.png']",/@cjus?source=post_page---byline--e58195828398---------------------------------------

The most recent hack dubbed #CastHack exploits vulnerable Google Chromecasts, smart TVs and Google Homes by renaming devices “HACKED_SUB2PEWDS_#” and by displaying unauthorized video that both notifies the victim of their vulnerability as well as encouraging them to subscribe to PewDiePie.
CastHack is the work of the hacker duo HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r. The same duo behind another recent hack that occurred back in November which forced tens of thousands of printers to print paper that encouraged people to subscribe to PewDiePie.

The purpose of this blog series is to walk through our product development process from the perspective of a manager on the product/design team. As we’ve refined and developed it over the years it has become known to us internally as theproductOpsWay.
The example referenced is the set-up of a Sales Order Management System forIthaka, an education technology company, but our approach is similar for all the projects we work on. Using this example, I hope to show the way various departments of our organization work with each other, and the client, to guide a successful outcome using a three phased methodology.
In the first phase of any project the executive team will travel to a potential client and get travel points and five star meals. On their return, the product and design team will get notes, a debrief, and image like this:
Do I sound bitter? In seriousness, this phase is an important and necessary step to understand the core needs and build a relationship with the client. The latter is usually achieved more readily after this first visit because most times neither the client nor ourselves have a firm grasp yet on what’s needed, the devilish details involved and the business or technical problem at hand.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EBt2XCfUXC2Li7LjNcaGng.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_eJZeU5Z3mHksAybmDsrnw.png']",/@productops?source=post_page---byline--40c6b9bd74df---------------------------------------

They’re supposed to be “the thing” to do when it comes to connecting to your congregation, but I have to wonder — do they really work? Are your members actually using your app to engage during the service? Do they check it throughout the week for updates or announcements?
Maybe it’s time to sit back and evaluate the ways we spend our hours as church communicators. If we are waisting our time doing something. Let’s stop doing that thing. Sound good?
The church app is one of those things that seems like a given at this point. Apps are for everywhere and for everything. If you use an app at your church, when it was first introduced, it was a source of pride that you could tell your congregation to find you in the App Store. But those days are gone.

With devoted adherents developing, refining, learning and executingconcepts to deployed applications, every day we come closer to interconnecting technology and services, one block at a time. As more power house giants and governments target new avenues, blockchain continues to flourish at an exponential rate similar to other technologies, as previously witnessed. Without a doubt 2019 will be a fascinating year for everyone involved in blockchain, and as a blockchain solutions company, we say that with confidence.
Here is a recap of the latest blockchain buzz last December.
The Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) has formed a strategic partnership with the Russian based platform, Universa, a new generation of blockchain technology that emphasizes on tokenization and contractual agreements. Such initiatives entail a 10 year renewable strategic partnership, where ATI will be providing hosting services to Universa to facilitate further development. What objectives can be expected? ATI will develop value added services in the blockchain field, digital economy, and digitization of paperwork. Likewise, Universa will aim it’s efforts to develop additional applications and services to integrate them into new tech platforms, create e- certification and the digital economy. Together both parties will also build projects with BaaS (blockchain as a service), an initiative that includes digital currency, digital identity, as well as e-governance and smart cities.
As blockchain captivates the interest of more government based entities, the push for solutions using blockchain based applications become fairly synonymous with identity management, digitization of documents, and overall governance to interconnect services and technology together.

ByRob Marvin
Over the weekend, a cyberattack disrupted print newspaper distribution across the US. TheLos Angeles Timessaid amalwareattack on Tribune Publishing’s software systems delayed weekend distribution of the newspaper and affected Tribune publications throughout the country. The print editions of theBaltimore Sun,Capital Gazette,Chicago Tribune,Hartford Courant, and a number of other Tribune-owned papers were published on Saturday without classified ads and death notices,according to the publications.
The attack also affected theSan Diego Union-Tribune, theSouth Florida Sun Sentinel,and distribution ofThe New York Times and The Wall Street Journal,the West Coast editions of which are printed at the company’s LA facility. Distribution of smaller local California papers including theGlendale News PressandBurbank Leaderwas also affected.
A source inside Tribune Publishing told theL.A. Timesthe company believes the attack originated outside the U.S. and was intended to disable infrastructure rather than steal information. The companysold both theL.A. TimesandSan Diego Union-Tribuneearlier this year, but the newspapers still rely on Tribune Publishing’s production platform and printing networks, the target of the cyberattack. None of the publications’ websites or online editions were affected, and the company said no subscriber personal data was compromised.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg']",/@pcmagazine?source=post_page---byline--576037d34303---------------------------------------

Forging into the new year, whether you’re just getting into cryptocurrency, or you’re a veteran hodler, chances are good you’ve heard about the ripoff schemes plied by malicious actors. Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene.
One of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys, or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at, and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions, which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack.
Another problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance, compromised Twitter accounts, sometimes even those verified by the platform itself, have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet, they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately, they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam, misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet.
One hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg']",/@ETH_Nation?source=post_page---byline--71ea04db3a9a---------------------------------------

The average internet user was supposed to spend six hours a day using devices connected to the Internet — a quarter of his or her life. To sum it up, it would mean that in 2018 humanity spent one billion man-years on the Internet. And there is no evidence that this trend is slowing down. More and more accessible mobile Internet, better and better smartphones make us believe that in 2019 we will be even more actively integrating the Internet into our lives. This will be primarily caused bymobile applications.
While a few years ago there was a lot of talk about mobile Web, HTML5 standards, mobile browsers, today it is becoming more and more obvious that this is not the right way to go. Applications have won the users’ hearts, providing more convenient access to information, entertainment, and various practical functionalities.
Mobile web became at best just an addition to the applications. Websites viewed on mobile browsers are first and foremost encourage users to install mobile apps. YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Pornhub, Allegro… Although they still work in the browser, they only show their full potential on the smartphone through their client applications. The same applies to every online shop — it’s great to have a mobile website, but the conversion rate from it is far lower than from a desktop site. Even small e-shops are commissioning mobile apps in the hope that they will find a new home on the smartphone’s start screen.
However, it is not only the convenience of the users that have influenced this situation. Another factor was the reduction in the cost of entering the market with a new mobile application. In 2018 only two mobile platforms remained on the market — iOS and Android. Mobile Windows, BlackBerry, Tizen or Firefox OS ceased to have any relevance. So there is no need to worry about them, no need to bear the additional costs of software development. Furthermore, React Native technology has reached maturity, thanks to which it is easy to build a mobile application that will work as well on Android as on iOS. It’s true, React Native has its limitations, but in the case of a typical enterprise or retail apps they’re not noticeable.
And on the horizon, you can see one more solution. Wherever the budget is not sufficient even for creating a React Native application, it becomes possible to use Progressive Web Apps. This kind of software is installed directly from websites, without the involvement of app stores. In many cases, Progressive Web Apps can provide users with more or less the same experience as the native app. And most importantly, these apps work well enough not only on Android but also on iOS.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*d7_aV6A1BmYAetkB.jpg']",/@a.golanski?source=post_page---byline--16b103f50b84---------------------------------------

Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management.
The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency.
Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors.
In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business.
According to Statistics, from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively, with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution, it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war?","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*yIaRbiqMwGGAXR9ZMe2-dw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-T9ZOp6pGanhk_ZsEZIHsA.png']",/@farhang.maghdeed?source=post_page---byline--da902318cff2---------------------------------------

Many of our attendees aren’t necessarily advanced in (or very knowledgeable about) the technologies we cover. They come to us curious, wanting to see something that sparks their internal, creative compass — even if they have no idea what that “something” might be. It’s safe to say that we’re all a bit overwhelmed with the number of disruptive emerging technologies emerging and developing simultaneously, each one promising to change global industries and the very nature of our reality in a mere next ten years: AI, machine learning, AR/VR/XR, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, gene-editing biotech, robots, automation — oy! Where to begin?! Imagining the future and your place in it has never been so complicated.
Knowledge is power, but curiosity is queen. As hard as it may sometimes be (we’re all busy and eternally distracted), in order to learn about the true potential impact of technology and to find our place in the ecosystem, we must feed our curiosity by constantly and substantively learning about the systems and ideas that are at the core of emerging technologies, including how global innovation happens, morals and ethics of businesses, corporate management and structure, societies and social science, etc. These technologies are challenging us to redefine who we are and what we want. The obvious question is: who are we and what do wereallywant?
Don’t let your curiosity go to waste. It’s your most powerful tool. It’s the anchor that will steady you in turbulent times as technologies and big ideas come and go. Learn and relearn what you thought you already knew. Revisit old concepts, learn new ones, and challenge current systems and ways of thinking. You don’t necessarily have to jump into the deep-end of the pool by taking expensive, months-long, courses in AI and machine learning that will require technical expertise you don’t have or necessarily want right now.
You can start the new year learning about concepts at the core of emerging technologies or the industries that are adopting them. With this knowledge, regardless of the market volatility, you’ll be able to think through what’s happening now, how the latest developments might impact your business, and what’s coming next. I’ve gathered a short list of free online courses that helps us to see “the big picture” and focus on the problems emerging technologies are being created to solve, as opposed to the technology itself (and even the problems that are arising as we implement technologies like algorithmic bias).","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*_8Ep4O6S1_LR4j02Y6FXIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*KaMW1QDg4-5aNmqdeCOQ1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*_8Ep4O6S1_LR4j02Y6FXIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*_8Ep4O6S1_LR4j02Y6FXIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*_8Ep4O6S1_LR4j02Y6FXIQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KaMW1QDg4-5aNmqdeCOQ1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KaMW1QDg4-5aNmqdeCOQ1w.jpeg']",/@itscomplicated?source=post_page---byline--ce7f5292d420---------------------------------------

When other investments turn sour, crypto will taste sweeter and sweeter.You heard a lot about the stock market’s losing year, but it was really just a regression to the mean after 2017’s profit party. So I think the indices will track upward this year — slowly, measuredly upward. Stocks will be boring. Bonds might be more interesting, but that’s not a compliment. As yield curves flatten and perhaps invert, there’ll be a disincentive to fund long-term projects, which is economic kryptonite.Prediction: Money will flow into crypto as a hedge on the bigger money that flows into cash.
Vocabulary will improve.Malta’s regulators distinguish between cryptocurrencies, security tokens and utility tokens. Other regulators will catch up. And the industry will then catch up to the regulators because what gets measured gets done.Everyone will be scrupulous to define what it is they’re trying to do with their ICO or STO.
Regulation will move forward, but un-regulation will move forwarder.Sovereign governments would be committing malpractice if they didn’t monitor the crypto space for KYC, AML, ATF and (especially) tax evasion concerns. So exchanges like Coinbase, which scrupulously adhere to all these standards, will continue to thrive by being a safe haven for institutional investors and other solid citizens who want to be — or at least appear — completely aboveboard with their crypto transactions.

In August 1994, 21-year-old entrepreneur and creator of NetMarket, Dan Kohn, sold a CD to a friend who lived hundreds of miles away. This was a revolutionary moment in the history of ecommerce, as it came to be known as the first purchase made over the internet and the first purchase to be protected by encrypted technology.
That same year, a 30 year old Jeff Bezos quit his Wall Street job in hopes of starting an internet company, and Amazon.com was created. The company grew quickly, and in 1999, Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos “Person of the Year” for popularizing online shopping. Almost 25 years later, Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the US.
In 1995, Pierre Omidyar founded the P2P retail site, ebay.com. The “auction”-style business model changed the way people shop at the turn of the century by allowing people to bid on items that spoke to them.
In 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes store and by 2004, iTunes had sold 100 million songs. iTunes was revolutionary in that it aided in the acceptance and expansion of social sharing — people could now easily share and suggest their favorite music to friends over the internet.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*xPaujiZFjzn7EF5u87kJow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*xPaujiZFjzn7EF5u87kJow.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*xPaujiZFjzn7EF5u87kJow.jpeg']",/@Pozess?source=post_page---byline--85239bfafd28---------------------------------------

The Key to Climate Resiliency: Innovation
It used to be that we could rely on past data to determine groundwater supplies or the potential for flooding in a given area. Those days are long gone. A changing climate is a present reality that has everything to do with our future water security. In 2017, extreme weather cost the U.S.$300 billion.

Although the battle against Alzheimer still has a long way to go, with no effective cures on the market and no promising results yet for drugs designed to slow down the onset of the disease, researchers can at least now hope to detect the disease decades before its onset.
Dr. Randall Bateman´s team at Washington University School of Medicine is developing a quick inexpensive amyloid beta blood test that can identify patients long before they start developing the symptoms. Identifying and treating patients sooner might help develop preventative measures.
Another breakthrough test, developed at the University of Queensland, is a universal cancer test that can detect traces of any cancer in a blood sample in 10 minutes. The test is based on the discovery that cancer DNA sticks to metal surfaces in a different way to healthy DNA, which is much more heavily methylated. This translates into a colorimetric test in which gold nanoparticles interacting with the patient´s DNA will allow the detection of cancer DNA.
Unfortunately 2018 has also opened our eyes about the great problem the planet faces due to pollution with plastic. On the brighter side, many talented researchers are racing against the clock to solve the issue.

Part of why we founded DEFcon 201 is to combat misplaced notions surrounding Technology and a person being “Technical”. Every now and again, I will meet someone who describes themselves as a non-technical person. This is in fact not true. All people are in fact technical. Everything from flipping a lightswitch to driving a car is in fact a technical operation. Most people use cellphones, computers, the internet, automobiles. Even those that do not, used previous generations of machines like typewriters, faxes, phones, and bicycles. These are all machines with histories. Engineered constructions.
Its always been like this. The very concept of civilization is a society and social evolution around machines and engineering. All known human societies are in fact known to use construct and use tools. It is noted by the peoeple who study as such as a common defining element of humanity. To us there is nothing greater to be more in touch with the human spirit than to understand and have agency of the tools we use, and define our lives. Be it computers and phones, or even automobiles, trains, and radios.
Some people have noted that others do in fact seek and master a greater understanding of the engineering in their surroundings than others. There is a misplaced shroud of secrecy and mythos surrounding these seekers and the machines they operate. It is the mission of our group invite the public to gain a better understanding and knowledge of the machines already in their lives that they use and depend on. For gaining knowledge and capaiblities in such system is to give agency, we aruge that it be the right of all peoples and persons to be able to understand such technology around them, as well as pursue technology to enrich and better their own lives.

The next time you receive a random dirty look from a stranger on the street, or someone says your clothes look weird, look at/think about the list. Not on the list? Don’t care.This is from an article I can’t find but do remember really well. If anyone recognises it please hit me up with a source so I can credit the original author.
We’ve all probably heard in some way form or another that Social Media is ruining our mental health, and too often we need to be “available” for people and we need to“reply in good time”.
When focusing on a task or something at work this past year, it seemed easier than ever for me to switch off and get distracted and open up Facebook or Reddit for a quick browse. If a message pops up on Android as a heads-up notification it’s immediately there, and in your face. I’ve started swiping them up or away as they are just so intrusive. I guess now it’s time to just turn them off for good. If you want you can go to the extreme and just place your phone on silent for good, with perhaps the option of including exceptions for calls from the most important people in your life.
Phones are amazing devices but the way that they operate as well as all social media distraction sinkholes is to get and then keep your attention. That’s why I’veremoved suggested videos from YouTubeand muted most notifications on the few social apps installed. I’vekilled the Facebook news feedfrom pretty much every device I own and resorted to using Chrome on my phone if I want to see what’s on there.

https://medium.com/@DonBasile/graphene-prosthetics-and-the-cyberpunk-future-f28d2715bc32?source=tag_archive---------150-----------------------,Graphene prosthetics and the cyberpunk future,"['Written by Don Basile', 'No responses yet']",,3 min read,Don Basile,"Within science fiction, particularly the subgenre known as cyberpunk, humans augment themselves with various technological devices and prosthetics to enhance themselves beyond human capabilities, or to repair themselves in ways that perfectly replicate body functions. So how do modern prosthetics fare compared to the technological marvels of fiction? While we have made huge leaps forward in bionics andmyoelectrics, we are not quite yet at the level of the cyberpunk future. But with graphene, we may just be able to get there. The material’s strength, light weight, and endless utility could lead to even more dramatic advancements in prosthetic technology.
In modern prosthetics,bionic limbshave done excellently in replicating movement and function of missing body parts for amputees, offering mostly full range of motion for legs, feet, arms, and hands. This can be contributed to the development of myoelectric sensors, which connect the artificial limb to the natural electrical processes generated by muscles in order to enable complex movement. Hand prosthetics in particular have made major advancements in replicating the intricate and specific motor functions of fingers.
Our advancements in prosthetics make it so that we can successfully regain lost function, but still lack meaningful tactile perception. While some might argue that the absence of pain is a benefit, the use of touch to perceive potentially harmful stimuli to the host would be a valuable addition to the features prosthetics provide, not to mention the emotional and psychological relief that may come with such upgrades to prosthetic tech.
This is where graphene can step in. Scientists have begun to use the wonder material to create agraphene-based skinfor prosthetics. This e-dermis electrically stimulates the amputee’s nerves non-invasively through the skin, replicating the process of signal relaying that the brain utilizes in tactile feeling. In addition, graphene’s optical transparency allows for 98% of light to pass through it, making the perfect material toutilize solar energyto power these advanced prosthetics. Of course, pain is not the only feeling that this graphene skin would allow users to process, and it’s potential to make the feeling from phantom limbs a reality again is truly wondrous to behold.
Even more intricate, graphene can potentially be used to create smallimplantsand internal prostheses that would be capable of correcting eyesight or hearing, to repair the body and help in overcoming degenerative diseases, or even help mend broken bones. Previously, silicon-based implants were too damaging to internal tissues if disturbed, and the conditions inside the body damaged the electronic components.

TOGAF is an enterprise architectural framework developed by The Open Group (TOG) international consortium. The latest version of TOGAF 9.2 is the result of collective work of many years by several contributors.
TOGAF has been adopted by more than 80% of the world’s leading enterprises and now a global standard for EA. TOGAF provides a realistic view of enterprise architecture highlighting the central role of an organisation. It is placed as a generic method, which groups together a set of tools and techniques for EA.
Any Enterprise Architecture effort requires a good collaboration — Governance, stakeholders, architecture and implementation teams are among the many subjects handled well by TOGAF.

Gambling software firm Playtech will pay approximately $32 million in additional tax to Israeli authorities following a civil tax audit covering a decade of activity, the company said on Wednesday.
Founded in 1999 by Israeli-Cypriot multi-billionaire businessman Teddy Sagi, Playtech is a leading gambling hi-tech company developing intelligence-driven gambling software, services, content and platform technology for a range of casinos and sports betting products.
The company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, issued a statement stating that it reached an agreement on December 31, 2018, to pay additional taxes worth approximately $32 million covering the fiscal years 2008 to 2017 inclusively after Israeli tax authorities “made transfer pricing adjustments in relation to certain functions performed by the Playtech group in Israel during this period.”
No penalties are to be imposed as a result of the audit and the agreement will cover the entirety of the Playtech group’s activity in Israel.

Since IoT has not yet penetrated the mainstream market, there is intense competition among the manufacturers on getting their products and devices to the consumers first. This often results in overlooking the potential security issues that can arise regarding data access and management as well as the IoT devices themselves.

Insufficient testing and updating:
As of 2018, it has been estimated that the number of IoT devices connected in connected and smart homes is 17 billion and will rise up to 20 billion by 2020.

Reinventing education is a challenging but urgent task. We are witnessing an exponential growth of technology. Artificial intelligence, sensors, data-analytics, and blockchain (to name a few) are amplifying and accelerating each other. This will lead to new applications across all areas of the economy and society in 2019.
In a digital age, any new approach to education needs to adopt a more “skills-based” focus that aims to build creativity. After all, we (and in particular the next generation) must be prepared to live and work more closely with intelligent, networked machines. The main focus of education shouldn’t be on the transfer of knowledge of standardized processes and procedures (these will certainly be automated) but on cultivating innovative and creative skills that cannot easily be replicated by machines.
In a world of smart technologies, a premium will be put on the most human of qualities; our capacity for unique and highly personalized forms of self-expression. And all education needs to be re-organized around this goal.

If there is one thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that rapid change greatly affects both what and how we learn. If there is a second thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that the evolution of technology is the driver of rapid change throughout our culture. Both of these factors in education and our culture lead me to question if teachers are being properly prepared to teach students whose learning is affected by so many different influences? The past learning experiences of educators are so different from the current and evolving experiences of their students that relevance as an educator is extremely important. Do today’s teachers understand the learning needs of today’s students?
A generational gap is a world of difference in terms of technology. For this reason I feel that many educators are products of a 20th century education that limits them as educators in the 21st century. Of course there are educators who have continually, professionally developed to stay relevant, but maybe not in enough numbers to make a great difference.
In the 20th century information was for the most part slower to change and often controlled by a small group of power brokers. News came from newspapers and magazines that were limited to publishing cycles and editors. The media was dominated by three networks which were limited by news cycles and strict editorial boards. Censors were assigned to every entertainment show to regulate the perceived moral agenda. Encyclopedias took years to amend and edit with an additional year to physically publish and were limited in circulation by high costs to the general public. Most households had telephones, but not a private line for each household member. The challenges of rapid change were not yet in place even though the stage was being set.
The Vietnam War began to awaken changes in the way we viewed the news. Journalists used more media tools in their reporting. Photos and film began to be broadcast in the news cycle, which was at a family-gathered dinnertime for most Americans. Students were moved by what they saw and many began to demonstrate against the government in numbers never before seen. These demonstrations then became media news as well, which exacerbated the anti-war movement. It took years of this to bring the war to an end, even with the help of the existing technology, which was controlled by forces heavily influenced by the government.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*52N_cBKyeuCjJ4gITM77YA.png']",/@joebrooks_cwi?source=post_page---byline--79391715b633---------------------------------------

As more and more people find new ways to contribute to social media, it will continue to unfold. Social media is an open platform and highly integrable with any other program or algorithms which allows for even more expansion and flexibility to make it even better. With these above ideas in mind, let us explore how social media will change as we progress.
1. Customized platform:With the integration of A.I. into social media, your profile and your social media will get customized according to your habits, behaviors, and personal preferences. You will be able to book cabs, order food and check your feed all in one platform. To be more succinct, social media will be an all-in-one app or platform for your daily needs and tasks.
2. Richness in quality of posts:The quality of social media posts will be rich in content and variety. As of now, you can see high-quality photos on Instagram. This will transcend all platforms. On top of that, the new IGTV feature in Instagram is gaining a ton of traction which will eventually convert to a mini YouTube sort of thing (already happening). These examples suggest a pattern or hint towards what we can expect in the future.
3. Videos:The Internet is more accessible now than ever. Facebook recently announced that it would focus more on delivering videos to your news feed and suggested that videos were the future in social media. If you are a frequent user of Facebook, you may have already noticed this trend. Facebook is going to add more videos to your newsfeed.
4. Customizable:Social media platforms will adhere to your preferences, tastes, and needs. This means that you will be able to select the themes and layout, customize the tabs, and design the layout you want from a selection of combinations.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png']",/@easytimetracking?source=post_page---byline--f6a3b747c4b0---------------------------------------

On the other hand, with the ease of software development, so (too) many solutions arise. Most of millennial are very creative, they create e-solution for almost everything.Do you want to save money? Go to bank, mobile banking, online investment, trading online.Do you need transportation? Book online, traveloka, pegipegi, tiket.com, etc.Do you hungry? Go to “warung”, go-food, grab-food, call delivery serviceWant to save photo? Go to google photos, instagram, facebook, NASHow about boring? Get netflix, buy voucher traveloka, open youtube
It was easy to define how much money do you have? Sum up your bank account, gold and house.Now? Don’t forget your mutual fund account in asset management X, Y, Z. Sum up also your bitcoin account, that might be fluctuated like roller coaster. Hmm..also you still have credit in GoPay. It seems you still have deposit also in OVO and Dana. How about credit in M-Tix, that’s part of your wealth also. And you can list down, as much as you can (remember).
It’s good to have a broaden knowledge about new technology/solutions arise. But keep your life simple! So many solutions that alike one another. If you take it all, you’ll ended up with too complex life. Review new solutions arise, if it’s better thenmigrate, don’t duplicate.
Here’re my own list for some function of life:* file storage for personal: use google drive* file storage for business: onedrive plus sharepoint (soon)* bank: use 1 main account, and 1 more account for saving.

We then learn to improvise as we select, modify, and perform these practices on the fly.
Planning
When we are first learning a craft, whether it is public speaking, music, project management, or cooking, we accumulate a toolkit of skills, one tool at a time, along with some concept of the rules for the use of each. At first, we learn one basic tool, such as the hammer, finding out which end to hold, what part is used to drive the nail, how hard to hit, and the like. We eventually master the use of the hammer, learning the “what,” but we have yet to learn the “why” — just when do you use a hammer? Then, to execute an entire project, we must learn the “what” and the “why” of many tools — saw, level, adhesives — and learn the script for moving from one tool to another.
Building the script of the sequence of which tool to use when, and how to use it, constitutes the planning of an endeavor. Giving a talk? Then perhaps you write out each word of what you plan to say. Then you likely read it. Your audience cringes as it receives the muttered, over planned results of your preparation.
Perhaps you advance to using bullet points, either on a notecard or on a projected slide, simply to tell you what you wish to describe next. Maybe you give yourself a running start by writing out only the first sentence or two of your talk, then move to the bullet points.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*M2Qv1T6L_CE63A9Z6xQtxA.jpeg']",/@john_goodyear?source=post_page---byline--beedce3d8fbb---------------------------------------

Becoming victims of phishing schemes
Stolen login credentials are the most common way hackers breach enterprise systems, and most of the time, these credentials are stolen through a phishing scheme. A highly targeted variant of phishing, calledspear phishing or business email compromise, is used to convince employees to wire money or send sensitive data, such as W2 information, to cyber criminals.
Avoid having your employees make this cyber security mistake by educating them about the warning signs of a phishing scheme. Organizations must also establish policies against sending sensitive data through email, ensure that employees have access only to the systems and data they need to do their jobs, and add redundancy into payment approval processes, especially wire transfers.

My name is Luis, but I go by my nickname, “Chief” I’m not entirely sure why, but some guys in college started calling me that, but it has stuck with me over the years. My personality is one of assertiveness, and I tend to research, project plan and act. I’ve been an IT professional for 18 years, and an IT consultant for 13 of them and the assertiveness has certainly benefited me throughout my career which started just with helping small businesses with their tech needs and over time has morphed into an operations and business consultant as well as an outsourced project manager.
Virtually all of today’s business depends on technology, this much we all know. The part that’s not so readily apparent is that for the technology to be successful, the right person all must be in place to leverage it. Technology by itself offers no value, and in some cases, it’s counterproductive to business. Most of my articles will revolve around technology, security, efficiency, process, and procedures.
I’m also a husband, father, and sports fan. So I may include articles that I feel are relevant slightly interesting that are worth writing about.

Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today, no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However, it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes, credit system and debt management.
The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop, or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer, but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency.
Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016, the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services, and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however, is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors.
In 2017, the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year, a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer, transparent, immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets, not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business.

Not long ago, going on a trip meant calling to book a hotel, printing out directions on MapQuest, and driving to your destination with a packed car. Those days are over. With the rise of technology, it has transformed not only how we travel, but where we stay. Luxe accommodations are popping up seemingly everywhere, with plenty of mobile apps and noise-canceling headphones to elevate your booking and traveling experience.
The secret to success
Technology brought us the internet, and what a wonderful thing that is. Something else it’s brought us? Ads. Booking.com is a leading travel e-commerce company andwhat it’s done rightis target its “customers at the exact point of intended purchase” using Google Adwords. Another secret to its success is that the site is optimized for customer conversion through the use of A/B testing.

It has created a platform and foundation that will allow all types of companies to share their creative work and get recognized globally. Therefore, we have compiled 10 reasons to help you understand how social media can effectively grow your business and get you new customers.
1. Brand Awareness— When you post on Facebook about the brand, almost anyone in the world can view it and engage with your post. This opens the gateway to so many opportunities and prospective customers.
2. Increase in Sales— This is the most sought-after consequence for business owners after they make their brand presence known on social media. New prospective customers in and around the local area get to know about your brand and will choose to try out your brand. If it is e-commerce, then you will have a lot of requests for shipping from abroad or local areas. It will depend on your brand category or your industry. However, it will surely contribute to more sales.
3. Better Understanding of the marketplace— Once your brand gets recognized on social media, you will start to understand the marketplace better. You will get more awareness about your competitors, the current trends as well as the general overview of the demand and supply of the products/services. This will assist you in refining your product/service and empower you to sell better and create an overall pleasant experience.
4. New ideas— By interacting with customers online and getting valuable insights from data, you will be able to get new ideas for your current product/service or maybe even about a whole new different product. Ideas come from a variety of new experiences and that’s exactly what the social media promises.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*cuMnIoAC1e5jwmbZBu3bSA.png']",/@easytimetracking?source=post_page---byline--cf9264df31bb---------------------------------------

People are constantly looking for side hustles to earn more money and ways to save the money they’ve already made. In the last few years, online banks and savings accounts have risen in popularity and offer a fantastic solution to traditional banking. While many people are wary of using asolely online bankand trusting their money to that entity, with research, you can find a great bank that provides better benefits than those of a brick-and-mortar financial institution.
Better interest
For most people, the greatest appeal of an online bank is that you’ll have a much greater interest rate for your savings account. Since an online bank does not have to worry about the cost of maintaining physical bank locations and hiring hundreds of employees, they’re able to offer a greater interest rate for your money, some as high as 2.0%. This number is incredibly appealing when compared to the average interest rate at a traditional bank, which is around 0.04%. Many people opt to continue to use a traditional bank for their checking account, but put their savings in an online account.
Equal security
Many are under the false assumption that online banks are simply not safe. However, online banks and traditional banks both have about the same amount of online security risks, since even traditional banks offer online banking. In order to make sure your money isas safe as possible, double check that the online bank you’re considering working with is FDIC insured and take security measures such as only accessing your account from secure WiFi and regularly changing your password.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*HPBB-x1AbCwi94s82jXdOA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*HPBB-x1AbCwi94s82jXdOA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*HPBB-x1AbCwi94s82jXdOA.png']",/@tejeshkodali?source=post_page---byline--a0549c60721a---------------------------------------

Por desgracia, distintos factores han motivado que la seguridad haya escalado posiciones en la planificación de cualquier evento navideño. Londres ha ido un paso más allá y ha diseñado un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial para identificar a cualquier posible sospechoso que se adentre en el centro de la ciudad. ¿Una medida necesaria o excesiva? El debate está servido.
La Policía londinense desarrollará durante la Navidad una campaña de reconocimiento facial que tendrá dos líneas de actuación. En primer lugar, se creará un amplio fichero con los rostros de aquellos transeúntes que deseen participar en el programa. Para ello, agentes policiales debidamente identificados solicitarán a los ciudadanos que se dejen escanear el rostro. De este modo, los británicos contribuirán a agilizar el trabajo de la Policía a la hora de controlar grandes masas de personas. La segunda parte de la campaña consistirá en la instalación de cámaras de vídeo con la tecnología de reconocimiento facial integrada.
Hasta aquí, las ventajas de la campaña son evidentes. Los agentes de Policía que están trabajando desde los diferentes centros de control pueden seguir en tiempo real la situación de las calles londinenses y, cuando aparezca un sospechoso, el sistema de reconocimiento facial activará la alarma pertinente. Conviene recordar que Reino Unido ha sufrido varios atentados terroristas de carácter islamista en los últimos años, al tiempo que el inminenteBrexitha generado una mayor sensación de inseguridad entre buena parte de la población. Con todo, tan invasivo protocolo de vigilancia no ha gustado a todos.
La organización Big Brother Watch ha calificado el nuevo operativo policial londinense como “autoritario, peligroso e ilegal”. Autoritario porque supone ceder a las autoridades la potestad de reconocernos en cualquier situación y sin que medie una orden judicial (en principio, de manera voluntaria). Peligroso porque una cesión de ese calibre puede volverse en nuestra contra si alguien lograhackearel sistema de vigilancia. Ilegal porque, salvo que se modifique la legislación vigente (y no está previsto un movimiento en este sentido, no es lícito grabar a los transeúntes de manera indiscriminada. Por ahora, los policías de Londres sortean este último obstáculo con la petición formal a los ciudadanos para que colaboren con el operativo.

We are currently undergoing a major transition in the STEM field of genomic research. While some people may look at the word genomes and immediately think genetics there is a difference. According to WHO, “The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.”
Identifying their combined influence is key in today’s scientific market. What doctors around the world are now learning pertains to the importance of ethnic diversity in clinical trial research. “Human genomic databases — collections of all the genetic information that has been sequenced over the years — are” heavily skewed to people of European descent, making it harder to correctly diagnose medical issues for non-Europeans.
According to Scientific American, “The community has learned that there are far more of these larger, so-called structural variations than expected. These are now known to cause genetic disease and impact the way drugs are metabolized by individuals and ethnic populations.”
Due to this revelation, there is now a push to include more minorities in clinical trials. The necessity of this is at an all time high as. An example of specific medical issues effecting a specific ethnic group can be seen in the Korean genome project which “found a population-specific variant in a gene that regulates how some medications are metabolized by the body; this is essential information for dosing and for gauging the likelihood that a patient will respond to a particular therapy.”","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*wiH9sDaTMAz2JE5r2lGdMg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*kzllALS6QCYYR5InhT991w.jpeg']",/@supplierty?source=post_page---byline--d7bbdd0063d0---------------------------------------

Hopefully your face. Maybe some toys. Possibly some outdoor scenery. A car seat, their car mirror. The inside of Target if we’re being honest.
But what else? More than likely, they see a lot of your phone. It’s always handy, and I get it. You want it right on hand to be able to snap the best pictures at the most opportune times. That’s the beauty of the cameras on phones. It’s convenient and you just never know when you might see the perfect picture.
But then they start to associate seeing you with seeing a phone. Where are we going to go from here? I challenge you to think about how much you’re holding onto your phone, how much your child looks at you and sees your phone, how much the phone is in front of their face instead of your face being in front of them.
How many “perfect pictures” do you need of them anyway? What are you going to do with all of them? Maybe post them on Facebook, on Instagram, your VSCO if you have that type of thing. Someday you might get around to printing them, only to realize they’ve grown up so much and don’t look the same anymore so you only have one of the pictures up and then shove the rest in an envelope in a drawer. What does that mean for the rest of the thousands, yes thousands, of pictures we have?
I try to leave my phone places. In the room, by the couch. I make it a point not to bring it when we go places. It scares me when I think about the fact my child could get to a point where he is more excited to see my phone than my face because it might mean I’ll be interacting with him to get a smile for a picture.

January 3, 2019
December 31 is the end of an era for Torontonians. It’s the last day, ever, that we can use a metropass on the Toronto Transit system. From January 1 2019, the Presto electronic payment system takes over, and that means that our ability to travel by bus or subway through the city untracked has radically decreased. We could buy a metropass with cash, use it every day all month by showing it to a fare collector, and no record that connected us with that card would be created. Not so with Presto.
Presto, now in operation in Greater Toronto, Hamilton and Ottawa transit systems, is developing a reputation as the system we love to hate. But the gripes you hear floating around about the switch from pass to Presto are focused on the fact that the Presto system is plagued with dysfunctional card readers, auto-fill errors that leave riders unexpectedly out of funds, and vending machines that are better at taking money than spitting out new cards. These are all irritating, but they’re likely to get fixed over time.
The big issue that we’re not talking much about at all is privacy — when Presto becomes the only option, anonymous travel becomes pretty much impossible.

Today, more than 850 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses, popularly known as Massive Open Online Courses orMOOCs.
I’ve compiled this list of 720 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveragedClass Central’s database of over 11,000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating.
I’ve sorted these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level:
Courses that are being offered for the first time are marked as[NEW].
Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later in January. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2019 on Class Central’sComputer Science,Data Science, andProgrammingsubject pages.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*j4P8XsM5-rq-xoQ8HdEFaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*MotlWcSa2n6FrOx3ul89kw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*j4P8XsM5-rq-xoQ8HdEFaA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*j4P8XsM5-rq-xoQ8HdEFaA.jpeg']",/@dhawalhs?source=post_page---byline--96988eb0c52f---------------------------------------

What’s going on?', 'Written by Colin Horgan']",10,8 min read,Colin Horgan,"Three days after Christmas, Twitter user Kilgore Trout (with over 51,000 followers)tweeteda link to a GoFundMe fundraising page, writing, “hello I am catching the crowdfunding wave but also being extremely honest please contribute today.” The reason for the GoFundMe page? “I Am Just Taking Your Money. There Is No Reason,” the fundraising page put it. GoFundMe eventually took the page down, but not before it raised $69 (“the perfect RIP,” Trout tweeted).
The page was clearly a joke, but one that resonated in the waning days of 2018, a year in which it seemed like just about everything was being exposed as a scam.
Kilgore Trout’s GoFundMe, for instance, appeared only days after another fundraising attempt on the sitewas revealedas a $400,000 scam. In autumn 2017, a young couple from New Jersey set up a page to raise money for a man they claimed was a destitute war veteran who they said gave the woman his last $20 so she could refill her gas tank. Before the story was exposed as a complete fabrication, the couple had been featured prominently by major media outlets that attached themselves to a heartwarming viral tale.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Oq0OapzJf30QEwi86wWM2A.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--ebeb909540d3---------------------------------------

Madrigal']",7,14 min read,Alexis C. Madrigal,"More than a thousand days after the water problems in Flint, Michigan, became national news, thousands of homes in the city still have lead pipes, from which the toxic metal can leach into the water supply. To remedy the problem, the lead pipes need to be replaced with safer, copper ones. That sounds straightforward, but it is a challenge to figure out which homes have lead pipes in the first place. The City’s records are incomplete and inaccurate. And digging up all the pipes would be costly and time-consuming.
That’s just the kind of problem that automation is supposed to help solve. So volunteer computer scientists, with some funding from Google,designed a machine-learning modelto help predict which homes were likely to have lead pipes. The artificial intelligence was supposed to help the City dig only where pipes were likely to need replacement. Through 2017, the plan was working. Workers inspected 8,833 homes, and of those, 6,228 homes had their pipes replaced — a 70 percent rate of accuracy. Heading into 2018, the City signed a big, national engineering firm,AECOM, to a $5 million contract to “accelerate” the program, holding a buoyant…","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*pak_yjCTEDIwFfp_oluevA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*KhLyRU7bqWfyGtP_ZhTF1Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*KhLyRU7bqWfyGtP_ZhTF1Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*KhLyRU7bqWfyGtP_ZhTF1Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*pak_yjCTEDIwFfp_oluevA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*pak_yjCTEDIwFfp_oluevA.jpeg']",/@alexismadrigal?source=post_page---byline--96e097378b9b---------------------------------------

For the tech industry, 2019 may be more about laying groundwork than historic breakthroughs. But it should be a busy and exciting year, as key new technologies begin finding their way into real, useful applications.
The smartphone will still be our central tech device by the end of next year, but as augmented reality and wearables progress, we’ll sense more and more that a new paradigm in personal computing is around the corner. That will be helped along by enabling technologies such as 5G networks, which will be stretching far and wide by the end of 2020. And, artificial intelligence will become infused in all kinds of products, allowing gadgets and services to subtly begin to anticipate our wants.
These tectonic shifts are already creating opportunity and chances for innovation. Venture capital investments on startup companies are on pace to reach $100 billion in 2018, far exceeding 2017’s $82 billion in investments.

All the stable releases of Angular are production ready and deployed by a large number of enterprises and users everywhere. Here, we’ll shift our focus towards the security aspects of Angular.
Web development isn’t about writing code that works, it’s also about writing code that’s foolproof and not prone to vulnerabilities. A number of common vulnerabilities for different web applications are regularly brought to light. Vulnerabilities can seep in through obsolete dependencies, bad coding practices, or irregularities in patching updates.
In this article, we’ll discuss vulnerabilities that can occur with Angular application(s) and the best ways to circumvent these vulnerabilities.
The Angular team is publishing releases at frequent intervals for different feature developments, bug and vulnerability fixes, security patches, etc. Software development teams are strongly suggested to keep their Angular libraries updated constantly to stay in sync with the latest available developments. If not, malicious users may be able to attack the application that is using known security vulnerabilities associated with older versions of the software.
With the sheer number of third-party library components available today, it can be a difficult task to develop applications without the use of these libraries. Libraries sometimes can have publicized vulnerabilities that can be maliciously used by attackers to input harmful data or code into applications. Some of the well-known vulnerabilities include CSRF, buffer overflows, XSS, etc.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*y9HsizGYH3vnBVusc-5lIg.png']",/@mesciusinc?source=post_page---byline--42789f1de1e0---------------------------------------

The demand for qualified workers to fill these positions is growing as well, which includes commonly found vacancies such as back-end and front-end developer, but there are also some less known ones as well. Let’s take a look at some of the most in-demand IT jobs of 2019–2020.
This is one of the best tech jobs in 2019 because the demand for computer vision engineers has grown at a steady rate over the past five years. Their primary responsibilities include creating and fine-tuning both computer vision and ML algorithms so that they can locate, identify and classify objects. Also, since AR/VR has also grown in popularity and is expected to be a $215 billion-dollar business by 2021, the need for computer vision engineer will also increase because it is directly on Ted with AR and VR.
2. ML Engineer
The ML (Machine Learning) engineers create AI systems and machines that are capable of learning and applying what they learned. They conduct advanced programming while working with convoluted datasets and algorithms to train their AI creations. What makes this one of the best technology jobs is that we see pretty much every IT company out there transforming into an AI company, therefore requiring a huge number of investments and making ML engineers a very in demand and popular profession next year and beyond.

Three years ago Danny Ocean, a cheerful Venezuelan with floppy hair and a silky-smooth voice, moved to Miami to start a new life. He scored a job in a pizza shop, but found himself missing the girlfriend he had left back home. As a Valentine’s gift, he wrote a song in his bedroom for her, wistfully crooning against upbeat synthesisers.
He uploaded the song, called “Me Rehúso”, to YouTube and Spotify. It began creeping up Spotify’s viral charts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which caught the attention of Spotify’s curators — the employees who monitor minute-by-minute listening data. They unanimously agreed to add it to their playlists, such as “Verano Forever”, where Spotify’s users lapped it up. Week by week, Spotify added it to more playlists, each with bigger followings, until two months later the song made it to the holy grail — “¡Viva Latino!” — which has the clout to catapult unknown acts into stardom.
In less than a year and with only one released song, Mr Ocean attracted a bidding war among the world’s largest music labels, before he signed a plum recording contract with Warner…","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NzwoyCqOszU1oXOkDqN8iQ.png']",/@Financial_Times?source=post_page---byline--5d6282a24c9---------------------------------------

On deeper thought, it is the only industry which gives you a chance to evaluate ideas and trends. I refer to it as ‘opportunity spotting’. Or a perch to look at what the future holds. When every entrepreneur you meet and every report you study speaks about AI, you tend to keep a close tab on it.
When I moved to a venture backed AI computing startup (Series C), it was this skillset of opportunity spotting that I took along. Performing a deep dive on multiple industries, identifying use-cases of AI adoption and figuring out market entry points was an extension of what I learnt in VC. I lost no time in applying the same principles and mental frameworks.
But I couldn’t have been more wrong.
At Columbia, I took quantitative courses centered around ML to get a feel of the implementation part of adopting AI solutions.

It only takes about 30 seconds of waiting in line at Nando’s before somebody recognises Evan Spiegel. “You’re not from Snapchat, are you?” a young man asks. “You are! Oh! Good to see you.”
Spiegel has got better at dealing with these encounters. Though he described himself this year as shy, the 28-year-old stands out today with his sharp dark suit, white open-collar shirt and certain kind of LA sheen. He immediately introduces me, as if the guy would care at all who I am, and asks what he is up to.
Spiegel may not be quite as famous as Mark Zuckerberg — nobody has so far made a semi-fictionalised movie about him — or the founders of Google. But as America’s youngest billionaire and co-founder of Snapchat, the picture-messaging app used by 186m people every day, this is the kind of thing that tends to happen when you’re hanging around in a chicken-and-chips joint.
During the course of 2018, Wall Street has fallen out of love with Spiegel. Shares in Snapchat’s parent company Snap are ending the year almost 75 per cent below their peak in February.

It’s quite well written & parts of the story are contributed by my friend & former colleagueHimanshu Gupta. If you haven’t read it, you can check it out here —https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/. As someone who’s followed the evolution of chat apps & used most of them extensively, i thought i’ll offer my thoughts on the subject.
A key argument in the blog is that Wechat failed to localize it’s product for the Indian market. In my view while localization plays a part in success of a platform, the bigger ideology behind the product & deeper market conditions usually lead to the success or failure of a particular product. Here by localization i mean adding/removing/modifying features or translating app text/content(Example local music in Tik-tok) or changing notation/icons(clap instead of like) not re-thinking the product for the native market & designing from ground up met to their needs specifically.
When launching a new product in an existing market, the most important factor is differentiation. One simply can’t compete with the same features for the same set of users. There are 2 approaches to launching a product — launch on a smaller scale, understand the key needs & iterate(something Newsdog is also doing with multiple apps) or (if $$$ permitting) do a big bang launch to generate curiosity among your users & try to make users jump ship.
Wechat when they launched in India focused on Voice notes — a feature used in China to a great extent to differentiate & the social aspect of the app.
The TV campaign got them a initial set of users but maybe in the end the users didn’t use the features highlighted. The set of users who used the app was still English speakers who preferred text messaging to voice notes.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4hePaFR-a_gPFNR7rkwtNg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*4hePaFR-a_gPFNR7rkwtNg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*4hePaFR-a_gPFNR7rkwtNg.png']",/?source=post_page---byline--6ec169ad77bc---------------------------------------

It’s a highly social dining event. The chef will often play to his table, picking on the youngest one by encouraging them to catch shrimp tails in their pockets or “fake them out” with a prank container of hot sauce that they pretend to squirt right at you.
When we went on date night, we were at a table of 6 — the two of us and four younger folks that looked to be high school age or early college. A couple of them were drinking, a couple weren’t, and the group of four was celebrating the youngest one’s birthday.
While this was still a highly engaging experience, we were shocked to see one common similarity among the younger folks next to us:Each one of them had their phone directly in front of their face for 90% of the dinner / show experience.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Of4VsYLqQhk49LBsZIdB3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*abRenZmSXa-oa2rm9tCJwg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*abRenZmSXa-oa2rm9tCJwg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*abRenZmSXa-oa2rm9tCJwg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Of4VsYLqQhk49LBsZIdB3A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Of4VsYLqQhk49LBsZIdB3A.png']",/@bethanymarz?source=post_page---byline--2ff48ee6bf5---------------------------------------

Frank Wong funded DJI with his university scholarship money back in 2006. The scenario today, is quite different, to say the least.
DJI’s annual sales are estimated at a mammoth $3 billion. And they have nearly 3,000 employees on their roster. As per the latest round of funding in April 2018, DJI is now valued at a cool $15 Billion — which makes Frank the world’s first drone billionaire. So, how has DJI managed to reach this enviable position? Let us segue into our first point — their Chinese origins.
Toattribute DJI’s success simply to low production costs courtesy their Chinese production base is a narrow and incorrect view. Sure, low manufacturing costs are a factor — but certainly not the only one.
Drone manufacturing is incredibly complicated and requires mastery over production processes such as injection molding and precision machining. Check out this cool video showing the manufacturing process for a drone frame mold:

Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR, XS, and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected, and now that’s been confirmed.
When Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers, it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue, in particular, so much lower than expected?
In Cook’sletter to investors, he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets, in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years, and now theissues with Apple’s product lineare coming back to bite it.
Any slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted fornearly 63 percent of the company’s revenuein fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters, Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless.
In explaining the lower iPhone revenues, Cook blames lower carrier subsidies, a stronger US dollar, and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company inan interview with CNBCwhen it was actually a response toa massive scandalover slowing down batteries in older iPhones.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*6OtO5KD9eF0hoE-ooIypYA.jpeg']",/@parismarx?source=post_page---byline--9215f813ee8b---------------------------------------

The open source board is compatible with all Compute Modules (1, 3,3+) and runs Raspbian right out of the box.
The StereoPi boasts a pair of CSI camera ports (supporting OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras), micro USB port, micro SD card slot, a couple of USB ports, 1X USB header, HDMI, Ethernet, SO-DIMM connector, 5V power connector, on/off power switch, boot mode jumper, and a 40-pin GPIO header — all packed into a 90 x 40mm footprint.
The StereoPi is versatile and has already been employed in some real world applications — such as pairing it with anOculus Riftto render people in a third-person view, using it withROSfor simple depth-mapping, andstitching360-degree panoramic images. Of course, the StereoPi can be used for a myriad of other applications, like building computer vision systems with OpenCV, live streaming video directly to YouTube from drone and robotic platforms, and even creating your own augmented and virtual reality systems.
Beyond Raspbian and ROS, the board can be programmed using Python, C, and C++, depending on the project. The StereoPi isn’t yet available, however a batch of them have entered pre-production and have been thoroughly tested, which means they will go on to post-production shortly and will soon appear onCrowd Supply.

Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook confirmed Wednesday that the latest iPhones, his flagship product, are not selling up to expectations. The news exposes his toughest challenge sincetaking overas chief executive officer from the legendary Steve Jobs: how to take the company forward when its top product has lost luster with consumers.
Cook has dealt with a series of controversies during his more than seven years in the role, ranging from the company’s failed Google Maps replacement launch and the need tooustthe head of iPhone software in 2012, to concerns over labor andtax practices. He has calmly navigated the politics of President Donald Trump’s administration, and so far has avoided tariffs on the company’s key devices as the U.S.-China trade war widens.
Now comes the disclosure in aletterto investors that Apple sold fewer than anticipated new iPhones, and would cut its holiday quarter sales outlook byas much as $9 billion. Cook plans to address Apple staff about the situation on Thursday at an all-hands meeting where he will take questions from workers, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Parents do not understand how dangerous the internet is, he says, pointing to a study by Seoul National University that detected similarities between the brain activity of cocaine addicts and computer-games enthusiasts. If he had his way, youngsters would have to wait for their smartphones until they had graduated from high school.

As data collection capabilities increase and companies collect unprecedented volumes of user data, the scale, frequency, and impact of data breaches have likewise amplified. These breaches, which have degraded consumer trust and led to increased government scrutiny, are the result of inadequate data protection and insufficient restrictions around data sharing and use.
As the value of data rises, it will become increasingly important to strike a balance between using data and protecting privacy. Failure to do so results in data silos, which greatly diminish the value of data for innovation and societal benefit. Emerging privacy-preserving technology can help provide a win-win solution, offering unprecedented user privacy protections while enabling new applications for data.
Blockchain provides transparency but not privacy: on current blockchain platforms, transactions and data are publicly visible. Privacy-preserving techniques combined with blockchain can enable new decentralized applications that protect data while providing users with transparency and control over how data is used. Theseprivacy-first applicationswill help restore consumer trust, creating a virtuous cycle that fosters development of data-driven applications.
We think 2019 will see a dramatic shift to privacy-first applications, catalyzed by three growing trends that reinforce each other: an increased user demand to control their own privacy, the rollout of new privacy regulations, and advancements in privacy-preserving technologies.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*frhodW_09eI_xldsIY8Veg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Dmimd2YaSveI-ieBoXNxqA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Dmimd2YaSveI-ieBoXNxqA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Dmimd2YaSveI-ieBoXNxqA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*frhodW_09eI_xldsIY8Veg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*frhodW_09eI_xldsIY8Veg.jpeg']",/@dawnsong?source=post_page---byline--c23953cc4ecb---------------------------------------

The Plus offers double the power (10-watts) over the original and features an assortment of attachments that can be utilized for any number of projects.
The Solderdoodle is outfitted with a high-efficiency, high-power charge controller and uses similar lithium-ion rechargeable batteries found in Tesla electric vehicles. With that said, the hot multi-tool has an hour of work time at maximum power (5000 C) before needing a recharge; however Isaac states that regular soldering sessions only last a few minutes long, so under regular use, the battery can last weeks on a single charge.
Considering that the Solderdoodle is portable and charges over USB, you can tap into just about any mobile device power source if need be — portable rechargers, laptops, or even solar chargers if they happen to be available.
As far as features go, the Solderdoodle is outfitted with a touch sensor that allows you to ‘swipe’ to different power levels, which is denoted on an LED power-level indicator. A switch on the back of the tool enables you to turn the tool on or off, and includes a safety mechanism that puts it in sleep mode when not in use. It is also compatible with a myriad of different tips — chisel, conical, wood burning, needle, spade, and blade, among others.

We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it.

The paperInstaGAN: Instance-Aware Image-to-Image Translationhas been accepted by the respected International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2019, which will take place this May in New Orleans, USA.
An image-to-image translation system is a system that learns to map an input image onto an output image. Unsupervised image-to-image translation has garnered considerable research attention recently in part due to the rapid development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that now power the technique. Previous methods were not suitable for challenging tasks, for example if the image has multiple target instances or if the translation task involves challenging shapes. Last month Google AI researchers introduced a state-of-the-art model capable of realistically inserting an input object in a photo with both a reasonable position choice and an accurate prediction of the output object’s size, pose, shape, etc. The team behind InstaGAN, however, believed even this advanced method could be improved upon.
This new research is based on CycleGAN, a GAN variant which can learn to translate images without paired training data to overcome the limitations of one-by-one pairing of pix2pix in image translation. CycleGAN can automatically translate two given unordered image sets X and Y, but it cannot encode instance information in an image. CycleGAN results however are not ideal when translating images involving specific features of the target. The InstaGAN system overcomes this problem and combines instance information from multiple task targets.
InstaGAN combines the boundaries of the target while ignoring details such as colour. Compared to CycleGAN for image-to-image translation, InstaGAN is more successful in generating a reasonable shape for the targeted instance while preserving its original context.
The research has been accepted as an ICLR 2019 Poster Paper. Reviewers indicated the method was novel and solved information problems not solved by previous methods with a clear explanation; that results looked significantly better than CycleGAN and other baselines; and called for additional controlled experiments with the model.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mbG2hAx42XZkwmTVwS2AXQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mbG2hAx42XZkwmTVwS2AXQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mbG2hAx42XZkwmTVwS2AXQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PrqgLL9XHoUR6U2JuQX9_g.png']",/@synced?source=post_page---byline--64fb7d0344ae---------------------------------------

This year, the tech giant Amazon will be engaged in a delicate political dance in New York. The reason? In late 2018, the company announced plans to base one of its two new “headquarters” in Long Island City, Queens.
Amazon’s leaders probably assumed that the decision would delight locals. After all, New York mayor Bill de Blasio was so keen to lure the company that he joined forces with his arch-rival Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, to offer incentives.
But local residents have not reacted as the city elites — or Amazon officials — might have expected. Instead of welcoming the new high-paying jobs, some locals organised community meetings to try to keep Amazon out.

If you have a company addressing any of these topics or are an investor looking at these spaces please be in touch. Of course, all comments and thoughts are welcome.
Tech is global— this was and continues to be true. Tech has become so significant that it now blends with national interests to such an extent that even autocrats are wary of tech companies. I’d heard a rumor that Jack Ma was forced to step down from Alibaba because he met with Trump before Xi Jinping. Whether that’s true or not it’s a sign of the times. Battles for dominance are playing out between nation states and it seems to be a two horse race between China and the US. Russia, North Korea and others have hacked many US institutions and attempted to interfere with elections. Softbank wascaught up in the Saudi MBS scandal. The EUhas been a tough regulatoron US tech companies but Europe itself isn’t competitive in technology — putting it at a significant disadvantage long term.
I’ve been thinking about community a lotand how technology can really improve day to day life. What makes a great town or city? One important element is safety and security. In 2018 I experienced bike theft, package theft and identity theft. Technology like Nextdoor, Nest, Ring,Bike Index, are helpful for consumers. More controversial is the idea of asocial credit score in China. In the US, the police are over worked and prisons are over crowded. I’m open to local government using cameras and AI to stop crime (and actually deter it). If people are smashing up scooters, breaking into homes, spray painting schools, orbreaking car windowsI don’t have a lot of sympathy for them — cameras plus AI can help record, identify and catch these folks. Police should have access to world class technology tools and perhaps they’d be less prone to using force.
Humans Are Underrated— I don’t see humans being replaced by robots or AI any time soon. Humans are super smart at general intelligence and their bodies are superior to any general purpose robot. But robots and AI combined with human intelligence in manufacturing or almost any other context are powerful. This is something Elon Muskwas reminded of the hard way. AI+ humans can create interesting things. What if skilled laborers working on a construction project were orchestrated, scheduled and even inspected by AI and they got to keep more of the economics (which goes to the construction management companies now)? There is currently ashortage of skilled laborin the US so look for humans to be augmented and not replaced in the short and medium term. AI can make it so humans can do more advanced work and AI can also be useful in training for new skill sets.
Homelessness and drug addiction are getting worse— this is straight out of dystopian science fiction. For some, drugs can be recreational or even enlightening but for a certain percentage of people they result in devastating addiction. Opioid derivativeshave gotten crazy.New ideas for how to deal with drugs like legalization are being explored in various States which is a worthy endeavor. Homelessness (largly the result of substance abuse, mental illness and a housing crunch) is a hard problem which has plagued anddivided San Francisco. There are some interesting new companies likeWeRecover,Two Chairs, andPear Therapeuticsproviding therapy online. AI could eventually be used to provide or augment therapy in the not too distant future. Building restrictions have become onerous and the construction industry is ripe for innovation.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*OD10eG2EEGueYsMaYtoH6g.jpeg']",/@tgm?source=post_page---byline--fd87b273d90f---------------------------------------

Seems a bit like an episode of Black Mirror, but according to recent tech innovations, that reality soon might not be far off. From tattooed biosensors to robot caretakers anddigital pill dispensers, there are innumerable ways that tech can transform the healthcare space.
However, before we explore the ways that tech can both assist and improve healthcare, we first need to examine the current and ongoing healthcare crisis, both globally and right here in America. Sadly, the problems that started over 50 years ago are still plaguing the global healthcare system today.
Globally, the healthcare industry is constantly facing challenges. Did you know that one in seven people on the planet is on-the-move? That statistic equates to abouta billionmigrating people — astaggeringnumber and the most there has ever been throughout the course of history. In particular, refugees and other migrants face distinct obstacles in accessing health care, including language barriers, cultural differences, unfamiliarity with local health services, and the inability to readily access quality healthcare. Their diverse needs also present difficulty; from migrant farmworkers who have been exposed to toxic chemicals to refugees dealing with the trauma of war. The global health implications of the healthcare crisis are ever-present in today’s world.
Additionally, the cost of healthcare both in America and worldwide has been an on-and-off concern for years. According to a recent Wall Street Journal article,health care costsin the U.S. are predicted to reach 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025. What the report failed to note was that America is now in our 50th year of the official US health care crisis — yikes!
Consider this: in 1960, healthcare expenditures were$27.2 billion, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In 2010, U.S. taxpayers paid nearly $2.6 trillion forhealthcare services. This statistic means that in two generations, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has increased almost hundredfold. So, what’s the solution to this massive healthcare problem that has plagued the U.S. for five decades? You guessed it: tech is now a major player that has just come into the healthcare space and may change the course of history.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eYIqhJWVCk9YG4WbL6BPwQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*g8d7z6nPdz1NCx6somGKEg.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@abolwell?source=post_page---byline--7600c73ba064---------------------------------------

With this thought, I, along with every member atTeam Koinex, extend the warmest wishes for 2019. I would also personally like to take a moment to thank all our users, backers and believers who stood by us throughout 2018 and because of whose blessings we are where we stand today.
Since the beginning of 2018, the digital assets and cryptocurrency market has witnessed a bumpy ride. Falling prices, fewer ICOs, unfavourable regulations and many more factors have kept the true potential of blockchain technology, decentralisation and a tokenised global economy from blossoming.
For India in particular, things became worse with the introduction of the Reserve Bank of India’s directive to isolate formal banking services from the entire blockchain-based digital assets industry. This was harsh, to say the least, as a few significant exchanges shut shop in India. A bearish market, unavailability of formal banking services, lack of initiatives and finally the complete absence of regulatory clarity dealt a crippling blow to an otherwise booming technology sphere.
Nevertheless, atKoinex, we choose to always look at the positive side. Everyone here is focused on solutions, not the problems. We kept our innovation going and we did our best to keep the industry alive and kicking. We created India’s most loved peer-to-peer trustful token transaction network —Loop.We also introduced a peer-to-peer INR deposit/withdrawal mechanism. We added 32 coins, 72 trading pairs across 4 markets. In addition to this, we introduced India’s first crypto gifting service and conducted numerous trading contests and competitions, giving away prizes over INR 1 crore. Along with these user-focused developments, our Engineering team worked hard on a lot of behind-the-scenes components to enhance the performance of the exchange: we built a world-class trade engine which could handle a million transactions per second. We also developed a real-time messaging service,Pushman, which filled the ticker and orderbooks with data, broadcasting millions of messages every hour. On top of the development, we continuously kept improving the security on the platform, which has always been our priority.
On top of all the things that we did in 2018, we laid out the foundation for our mission — making India a hotbed of blockchain technology development. We hosted our first#KoffeeWithKoinexmeetup in Mumbai in December 2018 which received a tremendous response; that was enough for us to gear up and plan to hold regular meetups in every part of the country in 2019. We partnered with another blockchain company in Bengaluru and co-hosted a developer-centric hands-on workshop on EOS blockchain in November 2018. We plan to organise many more hackathons and developer conferences throughout 2019.

Tim Cook’s letter.
What led to this?There are a variety of reasons to be factored but, I think that Apple overplayed its hand in raising the prices of iPhone to the extent that even loyal Apple fan like me hated. The smartphone market has begun to saturate and, the room for growth is steadily declining. Apple knew this already and, in 2017 they increased the price of iPhone touching 1000 dollars to combat the decline in the sale of iPhone. Apple got away with this cause the iPhone X brought loads of features compared to its previous model and, people didn’t care much to pay 1000 dollars to get the unique iPhone in their hand.
Apple should have been confident then to increase the prices of iPhone last year to meet the slowdown in sales but, it backfired mainly cause the latest model looked same as previous models. Apple should have brought some compelling features to justify the price hike other than new color and bigger size but, the things didn’t turn out the way Apple had hoped. Even the budget iPhone XR was turned away by the people which led to never before marketing and trade in programs seen by the Apple. There are other problems too contributing to lackluster sales of iPhone but, the price is what that disappointed even the most loyal fans.
Of course, Tim Cook didn’t mention this in his letter to the investors. He cited China and its economy as a prime problem. Yes, China has been Apple’s headache for years mainly cause of the decline in the economy and the trade wars which may very well increase the iPhone prices again all over. China is Apple’s second largest market after the U.S and, the things are not looking well as Trump threatens to increase the tax price of products coming out of China to the U.S including iPhone. Apple soon needs to reduce its dependence on China and needs to look other emerging smartphone markets like India for manufacturing and increasing sales.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*7QdXeMoYkSzeP9v320gSWQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*7QdXeMoYkSzeP9v320gSWQ@2x.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*7QdXeMoYkSzeP9v320gSWQ@2x.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--4c0b5e67b1f6---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@alitech_2017/top-10-technology-trends-in-2019-predicted-by-alibaba-damo-academy-8e5350fa7452?source=tag_archive---------45-----------------------,Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019 Predicted by Alibaba DAMO Academy,['Written by Alibaba Tech'],1,6 min read,Alibaba Tech,"FromAlibaba DAMO Academy
Machine intelligence has already been generating great impacts on our life while we are still used to the era shaped largely by information revolution and mobile internet. Advanced technologies, functioning like “magics”, are developed based on rules and trends spotted by human beings. Today, Alibaba DAMO Academy published The Top 10 Technology Trends in 2019. We hope that by grasping the pace of revolution of technologies, we can make better use of these “magics” and be in charge of our own future.
Dynamic and real-time urban infrastructure data, such as traffic, water, electricity and air quality data will be analyzed by large-scale computing platforms. The development of computing power and algorithms will foster the merge of nonstructural information such as video footages with structural information, making real-time modeling of urban simulation possible and holistic, intelligent decisions can be made. More resources will be allocated to technologies powering an intelligent “city brain” and its applications, while a city simulation model reflecting the real-time impulses and movements of a physical city can be built to facilitate the optimization of city governance. More cities in China are expected to have a “city brain” in 2019.
With cloud-based speech interaction modules become standardized and affordable, people can “talk” to more and more public facilities as voice becomes an increasingly important interface. In the future, there will be at least one available interface point in our surroundings for voice interactions. As speech intelligence technology advances, real-time text-to-speech on mobile devices would be almost identical to human speech, even passing the Turing test in certain conversations, such as ones using a robotic voice to alert about delivery status. Rules and regulations need to be established to regulate the industry, to avoid misusing the technology in advertisements, harassing phone calls and fraud.
For AI training in data centers, data movement between computing and memory has become a significant bottleneck. As a result, in addressing the challenge, memory-centric AI chip architecture based on the latest-generation of 3D-stacked memory technology will become mainstream. The demand for data bandwidth in AI chips will further motivate the use of 3D stacked memory, such as HBM (high-bandwidth memory) in AI training chips. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic computing chips will gain momentum, while researchers seek killer applications. Specialized AI chips may challenge the dominant position of GPUs for AI training in data centers. AI chips with architecture that truly reflect domain-specific features are expected to be increasingly used in edge computing.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*doanyR6AmLHe1ZcnauMrXw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*doanyR6AmLHe1ZcnauMrXw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*doanyR6AmLHe1ZcnauMrXw.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--8e5350fa7452---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@marta.p/digital-humanities-and-where-to-find-them-a7e34f80f8c8?source=tag_archive---------46-----------------------,Of code and culture: Digital Humanities and where to find them,"['In-between humanities and technology, a new field is emerging and many are still afraid to approach it', 'When it comes to the humanities, and specifically literature and new media, some people have already announced new land on the horizon. This is a place where metaphorical keycaps and quilts come together to enrich each other; where nobody is lame for reading classics nor for counting their words and analyzing their contents. Cue: the Digital Humanities.', 'Written by Marta P.']",3,6 min read,Marta P.,"Even in such a broad area like the humanities, a certainty seems to float around the life and work of any graduate of such arts: anything to do with the likes of Chaucer and Wilde has hardly anything in common with code and algorithms. That is to say, tech? Not on my critical analysis of late 14th century poems. This notion has been taken for granted for a very long time, becausestudents and professionals hardly found themselves studying on both sides of the academic pond, dabbling in both ancient writings and less ancient coding.
Luckily enough, the times are a-changing. A more diverse environment in tech is slowly emerging, and this does not refer solely to more gender mix and more skin colors. Thanks to the availability of tools for the strong-willed, programming is now more accessible to people with the most variegated backgrounds. Not having a traditional technical education can now also be an advantage in new ways. To get your hands on your code editor after your head has travelled to exotic mind-lands — those of art, and literature, and linguistics — can make you approach this field with completely different eyes than your desk neighbor, because you have seen so many, and so disparate, things. And it’s there that you can accomplish the coolest feat of all: manage to see even further, build on your previous experience to discover new conceptual territories.
These lands might be unruly and wild, difficult to explore, but they are also home to incommensurable treasures. The name alone suggests an opposition: the humanities, study area that represents all that is inherently art in the world, have now acquired a companion term that represents the future:digital. Using the digits. Critical analysis of literary texts can now be aided by powerful software tools that can read and synthesize books in mere seconds; we are talking amounts of books you could not read in decades. Investigative stylometry can help a great deal with authorship problems, like when the Computational Stylistic Group found that acclaimed Italian writer Elena Ferrante not only is not who she says she is —it has probably been her husband all along. Now-forgotten citiesbecome alive from mere mapsof times long gone.The miracle of word, paper, and brain on fire is given yet extra superpowers bydigits. Numbers and words, binary and vocabulary, forever united. Or is it the case?
Itcouldbe the case. Upon exploration of this young field, however, it seems like there is a hangup. And what could it be the hangup for such a happy party? Why, the guests, of course.
Ok but what are the Digital Humanities and why do I keep capitalizing it (them)?! It’s 2018, Google it. Actually, just check outthis link. It is a page that once refreshed shows a different definition. This is how uncertain these waters are. Here is my favorite, by Paul Youngman:","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*4I1gcnH1QDcMRhJFlVKtWA.jpeg']",/@marta.p?source=post_page---byline--a7e34f80f8c8---------------------------------------

It hasn’t been the easiest year for crypto — markets tumbled, sentiment slowed down, regulations tightened and the exuberance that characterized the market at the end of last year gradually transformed into a state of skepticism and reevaluation. A tough but necessary process, which is typical for every market cycle and amplified in crypto. We are going through a paradigm shift that is preparing the industry for healthier growth and more logical and structured valuation systems.
In 2018 we have laid down the foundation for the days ahead. We released the early version of the APEX mobile wallet with multi-currency functionality, and at the end of November we released Phase One of the APEX Blockchain Testnet, all of which is according to our short and long-term technology development plan. Equally important is our expansion of the team and talent, which has surpassed even our own expectations and has outgrown the Microsoft offices into our own 200+ employee office. Lastly, we were through numerous awards recognized by a large number of organizations including Red Herring for our technological innovations, current success, robustness and future potential.We leave a bearish year behind where numerous blockchain projects have found themselves struggling financially. However, we can confidently say that we have the runway and capital for continuing to develop APEX Network into the leading Blockchain technology, and to drive adoption in the enterprise ecosystem. We aim to create valuable and innovative use cases surrounding consumer data privacy, decentralized storage, and in general further use cases in “Data+AI+Blockchain”.
We expect 2019 to bring us both joy and challenges. The rollout of testnet phase 2, which includes a Virtual Machine, is expected soon. Mainnet will follow in the months after.
Thank you for your continued support, and best wishes for the New Year!
Sincerely,APEX Core Team","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*dLx2hsZU45kK3fLhxK30Bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*fdwX25CkYgNTJfDWuRNvzg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*dLx2hsZU45kK3fLhxK30Bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dLx2hsZU45kK3fLhxK30Bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dLx2hsZU45kK3fLhxK30Bw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fdwX25CkYgNTJfDWuRNvzg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fdwX25CkYgNTJfDWuRNvzg.jpeg']",/@jimmy.hu.apex?source=post_page---byline--678919ef3a7b---------------------------------------

There are a number of these governance models, each with advantages and disadvantages and some being more practical than others.', 'Written by Sal Miah', 'No responses yet']",,6 min read,Sal Miah,"These governance models weigh heavily as some of the most critical factors of a platform such as latency and throughput — some of the most popular governance models that every blockchain enthusiast will have heard of include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). These are the most widely used consensus algorithms in the blockchain space. This article pitches the three governance models against each other to give the reader a clear view of how these governance models compare.
The concept for the Proof of Work governance model was presented in 1993 before the term ‘Proof of Work’ was coined in 1999 by Marcus Jakobsson and Ari Juels. The core reason for applying the PoW model is to deter denial-of-service attacks by requiring requesters of a particular service to do work, and in blockchain’s case, computational work, before a block is submitted.
Many platforms have employed this consensus such that for one to mine a particular digital currency, they have to spend computational energy. Miners have to solve complex mathematical problems that require much energy. The first miner to solve the problem receives handsome rewards regarding the digital currency of that particular platform. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s case.
➡️Proof of Work also solves the problem of double spending in cryptocurrency. The more extensive the network, the harder it is for an individual to execute double spending because of the computational energy required to control the network. The kind of energy necessary to influence transactions in bitcoin is enough to power approximately 15 households in America; this is according todigiconomist.Herein lies a significant problem with PoW.
The world is trying to go green by consuming less energy and coming up with more ways to produce green energy. The computational power required for the mining activities taking place around the world is enormous. This is against what the world is aiming for regarding energy consumption.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NFkKXBy4WJlh7xyHFS0qWA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NFkKXBy4WJlh7xyHFS0qWA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NFkKXBy4WJlh7xyHFS0qWA.jpeg']",/@salmanmiah?source=post_page---byline--dcea481140f8---------------------------------------

When I meet fellow techies for the first time and tell them this, for example at a conference, I’ll often get a surprised reaction. There’s a positive reaction at the surface (“oh, that’s great”), but also a look that conveys an underlying confusion, and perhaps even concern. If put into words, it might sound something like: “How can you stay innovative and move forward in your career if you stay at the same place for more than a few years?” Or if put into more negative terms: “You must not really care that much about your career to stick in one place that long. I’m not sure I have too much in common with you.”
Take this brief exchange in the movieOffice Space, between the main character Peter who’s become disenchanted with his career, and his friend Samir who’s more in the ‘just happy to have a job’ state of mind:
I’ve always loved Office Space, it’s humor gets at the absurdities of corporate tech jobs in a way that I haven’t come across since, plus just hilarious. But as all good comedies always do, it also points to deep and more profound questions…
This exchange in particular gets at a tension in most of us, the ‘safe play’ vs the ‘fulfilling and exciting’. As the audience, we mostly identify with Peter, at how depressing it would be to stick around the same company for that long (particularly one as awful as the company that they work for, Initec). But if we dwell on this a bit more, I think most of us also identify just a bit with Samir. Does he actually have a point?
I think this tension is even more of an issue in the modern/western world than it has been in the past. For those of us lucky enough to be able to take the basic life necessities for granted (food, water, shelter, clothing, etc.) we’re often thinking less about how to keep and hold onto a stable job that will supply our basic needs, and are focusing more on whether or not we’re fulfilled in our careers. This dynamic is particularly strong in the tech world. Generally speaking there are plenty of jobs that will pay the bills, and the demand for programmers just seems to be growing, which puts more and more of the power into the hands of the employee tochoosea job that is fulfilling, not just whatever they can get to pay the bills.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*zydGhkAhrXtfnVBNYQ3KUw.jpeg']",/@jeffderrick?source=post_page---byline--baf48c999a69---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@gibellino/3-video-streaming-technologies-for-2019-d51b6b1223d5?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,3 Video Streaming Technologies for 2019,"['Written by Diego Gibellino', 'No responses yet']",,6 min read,Diego Gibellino,"The new year is here and there is no better time to list 3 of the most promising technologies I expect to see in production in the video streaming arena in the next months…
The Video Streaming Industry keeps experimenting and introducing innovative technologies, however the transition to production is not always as smooth as we would like or expect. There are implications in terms of costs, support by consumer devices, impact on established architectures, or, in some cases, a technology is simply not good enough for the market yet. The three technologies described below have an opportunity window in 2019. We will see how many services will embrace them.
In 2018, an increasing number of players offering OTT commercial services included live events in their catalog. In addition to traditional IPTV, Cable, Satellite and Digital Terrestrial distribution, service providers operating mainly on the Internet, managed to acquire rights for Prime-time sport events such as Football, NFL, etc... These events were distributed through adaptive streaming, mainly using MPEG DASH and HLS, to a wide range of different devices, from smartphones to connected TVs, taking advantage of one or more CDNs (trying) to cope with the traffic demand.
It turned out, however, that a major issue for this kind of services was the end-to-end latency or delay experienced by the user, in particular when compared to traditional broadcast distribution. Currently deployed HTTP-based adaptive streaming distribution architectures are usually behind broadcast of about 15–30 seconds, reaching 1 minute or more in some cases. This is considered a key aspect in terms of user acceptance, because subscribers are certainly not very happy to pay to watch a team score when their neighbors are already celebrating the goal.
Technologies exist to reduce latency, and in particular, MPEG DASH provided extensions since the publication of the Second Edition of the Standard, in 2014. However, only in 2018, with the introduction of Common Media Application Format (MPEG CMAF) support in products, we have seen implementations tackling this issue in all the important building blocks of the architecture: Encoder, Packager, CDN, and Player. First results are promising, with end-to-end delays comparable to those provided by satellite or digital terrestrial (5 seconds or even below) and demonstrators able to reach ultra-low latency (below 1 second).","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*AiknqLhVrAoH9GsFeVOSRQ.jpeg']",/@gibellino?source=post_page---byline--d51b6b1223d5---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@shaheenahmed/bandersnatch-the-meta-narrative-of-our-contemporary-times-6364a73eb60f?source=tag_archive---------53-----------------------,Bandersnatch: The Meta Narrative of our Contemporary Times,['Written by Shaheen Ahmed'],1,10 min read,Shaheen Ahmed,"A few days back, I watched Bandersnatch on Netflix. This is the first film offering from the makers of the ground-breaking dystopic science-fiction show, Black Mirror. True, to what Black Mirror represents, Bandersnatch, has altered notions of viewership and circulation in the history of the small screen. Set in 1984, the film is simply to say, the story of a teenage computer programmer who attempts to produce a highly conceptual and ambitious computer game, called the Bandersnatch.
What is the most important point of and about the film is the change in the idea of viewership. The viewer is no longer a passive viewer, but an active participant in the history of cinema. The viewer is a ‘proscumer’, a producer as well as a consumer of the film. The viewer is the story teller and the director of the film as the film progresses. From making the decision about what to eat for breakfast to what music to listen to whether commit suicide or murder, the viewer gets to control the narrative, or so it appears.
This is however, not the first foray into ‘make-your-own-adventure’ storytelling. As hasbeen written, there has been much experiments in literature and in Netflixitself. I am not going to go into the history of this genre, but will try and explain what makes Bandersnatch a one-of-its kind in the history of cinema that will mark the history of not just cinema but also digital humanities.
Bandersnatch is not the first Black Mirror special during Christmas season. In 2014, the series showed its first special, White Christmas. After four years, it has come with a new special which has, as an understatement, shaken all its viewers. This is the first ‘film’ by the creators of the show and was streamed on Netflix globally on 28th December 2018. On the first glance, it looks the usual Black Mirror staple where the human fear of being controlled or annihilated by technology plays out. But, that is where the similarities with any other Black Mirror offering ends.
I got to know about Bandersnatch when I chanced upon its trailer on Boxing Day on the show’s Facebook page. Like any other devout fan of the show, I was eagerly looking forward to the ‘film’. On the appointed day, I opened the Netflix website. I hovered my mouse over the Bandersnatch icon. The blurb showed that its about 90 minutes long. This appeared to me as usual. A Black Mirror special is not really of any longer duration. Bandersnatch, however, proved to be anything but the usual. It took me over three hours to finally ‘finish’ the film and over 90 minutes to actually understand that the director of the story is not David Slade. The film starts to offer you the option to ‘choose’ the moment you click the play button. Naive me, thought it is a new Black Mirror style of presenting the story. Although, the lack of the time code struck me as something odd, it still didn’t strike me till I was halfway through the film, that it was me who had the control of the story and be an active consumer of it. Much has already been written about the many endings of the show, the gargantuan amount of permutations and combinations of the film, including the final duration of the film. What I would like to concentrate on is not the possible or plausible endings, but the treatment of the film and the philosophy of the one figure who drives the film — how Charlie Brooker, the writer, doffs his hat to one of the most influential writer of science fiction in the 20th century and the one historical period that has fascinated most of the science fiction visualisations of the 21st century — the decade dominated by garish fashion and big hairdos, the 1980s.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*k_j03xvqzaKd4kGY']",/@shaheenahmed?source=post_page---byline--6364a73eb60f---------------------------------------

For most of the world, the new year happened two days ago. For us, it’s today. As we enter the second crypto decade, we’ve chosen a new date as our time to reflect back and think about the future.
Bitcoin was launched on 3 January 2009, exactly 10 years ago. For us in crypto, this is the most significant date there is. To mark our commitment both to the industry and the unique culture that emerged in this community, we propose a new New Year. 2019 AD with its beginning on 1 January doesn’t really have much significance for us. Rather than that, we’re celebrating the year 10 AB starting on 3 January. Anno Domini becomes Anno Bitcoin.
After the massive bull run of 2017, people have been talking about 2018 as a down-period for crypto. For those of us in the industry, it has actually been the more exciting year. The bull run was a crazy period that saw the entire industry scrambling just to keep up with demand. After the rally, we were able to examine our processes and improve our foundation for the future.But the thing is, 2018 hasn’t really been a down-period. Now that the year is over, we can look back and put it in perspective. In comparison with 2017, both the trading volume and total number of trades increased significantly.
On the industry side, these numbers show a very successful year, with definite growth. The reality for investors, however, is a bit different. Prices have gone down across the board, but the situation is better for some cryptocurrencies than others. There’s a belief that prices move more or less in unison — the market follows the movements of BTC. But if we take a look at the average prices over the entire year and compare that with the current price, the picture looks a bit different, with some of the 5 cryptocurrencies Bitstamp supports currently sitting much further from their average than others.
For us at Bitstamp, the last year of the first crypto decade was all about growth. We continued scaling our team in all departments and reached a few important partnerships to improve our tech arsenal. In November, we partnered with Cinnober, a global independent provider of technology solutions for the finance industry, to create a new matching engine for our exchange.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*NCS8vXvaUz6lNtacUP1gxA.png']",/@bitstamp.blog?source=post_page---byline--515ea91ae79f---------------------------------------

When welaunchedthe Measure Tool in Google Earth, you told us that, while you enjoyed measuring the area ofFasta Åland(685 square kilometers), the footprint of theTaj Mahal Garden(17 hectares), and the perimeter ofMachu Picchu(1,460 meters), you needed more flexibility. Some of you work with maritime navigation and aeronautics, some of you need to measure long distances with high precision, and some of you (like me!) just have really strong opinions on the whole “meters versus feet” thing.
We heard you, and your feedback has made the Measure Tool even better. Now you can pick from the same wide variety of distance and area units you may know from Google Earth Pro — including nautical miles, both feetandmeters, and yes, even the venerablesmoot. Just use the Measure Tool to measure a distance or area, then click or tap on the result to convert it into different units. Selecting “automatic” will choose units for you based on the distance or area you’re measuring, whether your country uses metric or imperial units, and your preferences.
We hope this change will give you more power to go measure more things, like the distance fromTokyo to Manila(1,617 nautical miles), the size of theChoctaw nation(2,813,763 hectares), and the footprint ofLondon’s Hyde Park(350 acres).

Brazil
Ours is a pretty typical immigrant story. My family was very poor when I was growing up in Brazil and struggled to find opportunities to succeed. My parents saw the US as the land of opportunity and wanted to move in hopes of providing a better life with more possibilities for my brother and I.
Well, I was 16 years old at the time. I didn’t have much choice in the matter and as a teenager that’s difficult. I also didn’t speak any English upon arrival — so you can imagine the vulnerability of a teenage boy who doesn’t speak the language being thrown into the culture of an American high school. It was difficult to get around, to get things done, to study, to meet friends — pretty much everything was a challenge at first.
Luckily the biggest overhead element in our business is paying our team members, and we started with one other person besides my wife and I, so we knew we wouldn’t necessarily pay ourselves a salary at first as long as we could cover expenses, and I was fortunate to have a few freelance web development clients that agreed to come on board when I shared that I was starting an agency — so at the beginning — as long as we didn’t lose them while we were trying to also bring on new clients, we’d have enough cash flow to pay our developer. Since then our team has quadrupled and monthly revenue has increased by 500%. My wife and I didn’t start paying ourselves a salary probably until about 6 months in if I remember correctly, and we were investing profits back into things like building our own website for the business which is obviously crucial as a web development company. We’ve now grown to a point where we have other expenses like our headquarter office space in St. Petersburg, FL — but since all of our employees are remote, this isn’t something we needed right away.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*apyfWtJGQqM1LAoO']",/@aminerahal613?source=post_page---byline--42ef4f4ae376---------------------------------------

And I’ve thought about this story for the last 5 years. I make mental notes on my Pixel, my iPad, in Google Keep, on a notepad, and discuss-it-to-death sessions with my patient wife, Rashida Shams.
And I think I have nailed it. Here is a distillation of the collective wisdom from countless books I’ve read, meetings with hundreds of newsmakers, eccentrics, philosophers, and mysticals over hedonic lunches, coffees, dinners andqawahsessions — and working with some of the most talented, inspirational people in three (3) Fortune 500 companies and five (5) startups.
Note: This is not an exhaustive list.There might be 11 rules.
#1 — Embrace your passion.Countless pundits have said this. Numerous movies made, speeches given, words spoken. There is a reason. There is no passion to be found in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. Live by choice, not by chance. Whatever your passion, just do it. The world will reciprocate. Money will follow. Dreams will become realities. Take the first step — today.
#2 — Take care of yourself, first.Eat, drink, think, sleep, and live better. Research repeatedly proves this. A healthy body + a healthy mind = amazing experiences. Stretch in the morning. Eat a garlic clove everyday. Drink water. Munch less. Eat nutrient-dense foods, not calorie-dense. Last meal at the 3-hour mark before sleep. Brush your teeth. Comb your hair. Wash your face. Looking good, confidence, calm mind, bright skin, and a positive outlook are wired together. Make peace with your past. You don’t need to be better than anyone else; you just need to be better than you used to be.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-hJPxYf6ouZVw1S-Mz2A_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*skRr4ICx9SXZTE7OcH8XXg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*skRr4ICx9SXZTE7OcH8XXg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*skRr4ICx9SXZTE7OcH8XXg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-hJPxYf6ouZVw1S-Mz2A_w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-hJPxYf6ouZVw1S-Mz2A_w.jpeg']",/@shamstastic?source=post_page---byline--c7561070554e---------------------------------------

The journey through this degree was not what I or many of my peers had expected it to be. Truthfully, I thought being an engineer would involve me tinkering with electronics, motors, and gizmos endlessly.
Instead, the following four and a half years were filled with constant learning of material my immature brain was not quite prepared for. While I believe my institution does a good job at transitioning students from high school to college, the majority of freshmen simply cannot fathom the effort and discipline required to succeed in a STEM degree. Four years of painstaking persistent dedication.
This is not to say I have not enjoyed my academic experience in engineering. On the contrary, I’m disappointed now that I will not have access to the brilliant teachers and minds at my school. Yet, I think it is dangerous to enter a field with false notions of what is entailed. For one, this can result in a considerable loss of time and money. For novice engineers or those considering pursuing the field, I hope to dispel incorrect beliefs or stereotypes of an engineering degree.
Classes Focus on Theory and Fundamentals
For the first solid year, possibly two, engineers learn the absolute basic mathematical backgrounds required for the majority of their field. Classes perform a broad exploration of various math topics. Content can often feel random, and it’s application not immediately clear. In Calculus I, topics covered include linearization, Taylor series, and various trigonometric integration techniques. I cannot remember when I last used any of the above methods or topics. Yet, this does not suggest such topics are pointless.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*vBCUidizvMnFhM_KpgY1hQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--d1d0851d69ed---------------------------------------

This brought us to two important questions:Whatwould be required to impede the deployment of SI? And,Howcan we make sure that happens?
Inregards to thewhatquestion, we can use nuclear monitoring and Mutually Assured Destruction as a model. If many world powers create artificially intelligent agents that are poised to crossover to HLMI and then to SI, and these world powers monitor each other and set up ICBMs to destroy HLMI agents that have been “deployed,” a stalemate could be achieved. This theory assumes that we will be able to successfully monitor HLMI development. While HLMI development cannot be monitored by environmental monitoring, advances in specialized technologies could facilitate monitoring of government entities and corporations with the capacity to develop HLMI. An analog to the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act could be enacted to criminalize private citizens developing HLMI. While monitoring all private citizens capable of developing HLMI would be challenging, the level of computing power and specialized skills required would shrink the pool significantly.
You might be thinking — do we really want to create an international monitoring agency that will monitor private citizens with powerful computers?Idon’t want that. But Ireallydon’t want to jump on the Bostrom train either — pushing down the gas pedal on SI development and putting the hopes of human survival into a highly uncertain method for controlling SI. Would a global monitoring system be any less dystopic than the various possible existential catastrophes Bostrom outlines? We have accepted monitoring systems for nuclear testing, and we were close to doing the same for biological weapons — why wouldn’t we do the same for an equally terrifying threat to human survival?
Side note:A halt on HLMI deployment does not mean a halt on all technological developments. Halting HLMI would not, for instance, impede important medical advances that use machine learning but are extremely specialized. These medical devices, while incredible, are not “generally intelligent,” and neither — for that matter — are self-driving cars or SIRI. Just because technologies do certain human tasks very well (e.g. driving or speech recognition), does not mean that they have Human Level Machine Intelligence (being able to do almost all human tasks as well as the average human).
Inregards tohowquestion, I think that the progression of artificial intelligence improvements will naturally attract mass interest in SI.Huge numbers of people will be pushed out of jobs due to improvements in specific artificial intelligence. If those people can be made to see that mechanization is the true driving force behind their suffering — rather than being distracted by scapegoats like globalization and Mexicanization — then there might be enough anti technological advance momentum to impact political decisions. Maybe when 3.4 million Americans are replaced by self-driving vehicles mechanization’s downsides will become unavoidably obvious. But, we must not assume that it will. To impede the power of scapegoating, we need to spread this discussion to the people who will be most impacted by job loss from specialized AI.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YfSUuvtC7C5mh8Fob3jOHA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PO2dJP9MV8LZ87Du9gddrw.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@Crux_of_Orion?source=post_page---byline--f4973cec14b5---------------------------------------

WhenBrian EnoleftRoxy Musicin July 1973, he claimed to the music press that he was planning to form a new ensemble called Luana And The Lizard Girls — a provocative undertaking which, as Eno biographer David Sheppard related, would only perform “in improbable venues such as launderettes and massage parlours”. Luana And The Lizard Girls didn’t happen, but Eno’s stated aim (to “drag together a bunch of bizarre people”) came to fruition when sessions began, two months later, for his first solo album,Here Come The Warm Jets.
Listen toHere Come The Warm Jetsright now.
Not that the musicians Eno gathered around him could — or should — be described as “bizarre”, exactly: more that their disparate and contrasting styles represented a determined (and career-long) desire on Eno’s part to encourage fresh and intuitive modes of thought, eradicate boundaries, and throw the mixture up in the air and construct enduring art from the falling fragments.
Among those filing into London’s Majestic Studios in September 1973 were guitarists Robert Fripp (King Crimson), Chris Spedding and Paul Rudolph (Pink Fairies), bassists John Wetton, Busta Jones and Bill MacCormick (Matching Mole), drummer Simon King (Hawkwind), and a clutch of Eno’s former Roxy Music bandmates. An all-star assemblage, but the results were mercifully free of the extended jamming one might have expected, cleaving instead to Eno’s subversive avant-pop tendencies. Here was a bold sonic statement which, in part, just about qualified as a glam curtain call, but which also hinted at enticing new avenues of expression.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*wMK7ozXWKoKn0m5wF7t2pA.png']",/@uDiscover?source=post_page---byline--c478ee2831d9---------------------------------------

What many first time entrepreneurs don’t learn till later is that it’s not a one way street. Founders need to do just as much due diligence on their investors as is done on their company. Even fewer realize that fundraising etiquette runs both ways. Here is advice that I either learned through experience or had other founders share their stories.
The number one frustration that each founder has experienced is ghosting from an interested investor. Helena Fogarty atMi OlaActive Swimwear expressed, “Ghosting really sucks. We’d all rather hear ‘I’ve decided no.’ or ‘Now is not the right time for me,’ than the ghost.”
Everyone values their time and it shows a lot more respect for the other person to not be strung along.

In this article, I’ll look over the ugliest and strangest iPhone concepts that I can pull from the depths of the internet. Get ready to vomit.
Obviously ,this was an iPhone 5 concept. I think what makes it really ugly is partly the square home button, wider screen, and plastic/rubber volume buttons. I don’t think we’ve ever seen an iPhone that can fit 5 apps side to side, and I know that at least since the iPhone 4 we have had metal volume buttons, and obviously only had two styles of home buttons — ever.
This phone was given the strange name of the iPhone 3GSRE, to be launched after the 5S. It almost looks like an iPhone 4, but obviously ,this was made before the 5S (Pre iOS 7 design and home button with a square in it). What I find weird about this phone is also the volume buttons, I don’t think we’ve had an iPhone with volume buttons with a dip in it.
This was an iPhone 3GS concept. This concept has so many things wrong with it. From the antenna bands to the somehow off looking home button, the centered camera, and front camera and earpiece. I cannot even stand to talk about all of the problems that I see, from this pre-Spotify looking Spotify, the Phonify on the back (probably just the name of the renderer) and how big the screen would be from scale of the icons at the top.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*1FXygHVbMsOxBEMhRHrSTg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*YZTlvPAjhrJYNxei_HrNcg.jpeg']",/@LilRamenCHS?source=post_page---byline--9bf007cfd594---------------------------------------

The monetary base includes central bank notes and bank accounts; commercial banks accounts denominated in both national and foreign currencies; and foreign currency in the form of bank notes.
In addition to these traditional means of exchange, at the end of the 20th century, e-money that could be emitted by non-bank financial institutions began to grow in popularity and adoption. Complimentary local currencies based on credit as a means of exchange also became increasingly popular. In the 21st century, the range of exchange instruments expanded due to virtual currencies including cryptocurrencies.
The emergence and expansion of these new private means of exchange raise questions for regulatory authorities as to the best way of regulating their emission and circulation. Choosing an adequate model of regulation demands a full examination of their economic properties and attributes. One of these new means of money circulation that is yet to receive an official interpretation is decentralized credit networks, which allow for the exchange of goods without a bank acting as an intermediary.
The credit network model has the form of a weighted graph, where the value of the graph corresponds to economic agents, and the value of the graph’s edges represents the amount of credit an agent is willing to give to their counterparty.
In a centralized credit network, there is only ever one participant to whom all other participants directly provide a loan. In this model, the provision of credit by ordinary network participants to each other is only made possible through the mediation of a person or institution who is at the center of the network.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*hbsEOv-zkKI-LYLYf1yZvg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*LEobJlc-NhEWML0vTokdcA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*hbsEOv-zkKI-LYLYf1yZvg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*hbsEOv-zkKI-LYLYf1yZvg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*hbsEOv-zkKI-LYLYf1yZvg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*LEobJlc-NhEWML0vTokdcA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*LEobJlc-NhEWML0vTokdcA.jpeg']",/@maxdemyan?source=post_page---byline--e16f69aec307---------------------------------------

We also want those movies to play at a steady24 fps(or higher) without tearing or jumpiness. With that said, what if we were to slow those movies down, way down to say, like 24 fph (frames per hour)? That’s the idea behind Bryon Boyer’sVery Slow Movie Player(VSMP), which will play a roughly two-hour movie on an ePaper display over the course of about 8,000 hours or approximately a year.
On the technical side, Bryon’s VSMP features a Pervasive Displays’ 7.4-inch ePaper display (480 x 800- 126dpi), which is connected to aRaspberry Pi Zerorunning a Python script that converts a frame from a movie file into a black and white dithered file and then sends it to the screen. The whole setup is packed into a creative 3D-printed case that can be positioned or hung like any digital photo display.
Bryon came up with the VSMP idea while walking around Brasilia and studying the city’s beautiful architecture and noted that the city was “designed to be “read” at the speed of a vehicle, so taking in Brasília by foot is like watching a movie in slow motion.”

Lightning Network for Dummies,"['HODL Finance', 'Published in HODL Finance', 'Written by Hodl Finance', 'No responses yet']",,2 min read,Hodl Finance,"Gintautas Scerbavicius
The initial popularity of blockchain technology was fueled by its decentralized nature. The traditional way of exchanging currency on-line always includes a third party. A bank is needed to ensure that the transaction is correct and that the sender has the money to send. In a distributed ledger, a central party is not needed at all — double-spend is ensured by the blockchain. Another factor that triggered popularity is the idea of money that is not controlled by any government, but by the people.
Blockchain lets us run a public record of transactions which ensures the legitimacy of all transactions and the rules are implemented from the very start through the technology itself and the smart contracts they use. Still, it is not without its limits.
The two most popular currencies that use blockchain, Ether and Bitcoin, suffer from the same problem. They lack scalability. Due to the massive popularity of Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the number of transactions has skyrocketed and issues have become apparent.
The time to complete a transaction went as high as 78 minutes per transaction and the fees went as high as $50. These kinds of limitations are present with many of the cryptocurrencies. Therefore solutions are needed. For Ethereum it is Sharding, for Bitcoin — Lightning Network.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*5fYwawAd6_SeG1UPyiHjVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*2-0R3WZEPGaciLJsgyDK4Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*5fYwawAd6_SeG1UPyiHjVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5fYwawAd6_SeG1UPyiHjVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5fYwawAd6_SeG1UPyiHjVQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2-0R3WZEPGaciLJsgyDK4Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2-0R3WZEPGaciLJsgyDK4Q.png']",/@HodlFinance?source=post_page---byline--9cf085196742---------------------------------------

Regulating speech is difficult even under the best of conditions, and the internet is far from the best of conditions. Its patchwork system of regulation by private entities satisfies no one, yet it is likely to endure for the foreseeable future.
By way of explanation, consider a case in which authority is (mostly) centralized and the environment is (mostly) controlled: my own. I am a professor, and if a student regularly made offensive remarks in class, I would meet with that person and try to persuade him or her to desist. (For the record, this has never happened to me.) If the person continued, I would at some point seek to ban the student from my class, with the support of my university.
Yet this solution is not as straightforward as it seems. Maybe it’s good if you trust my judgment, but it is not readily scalable. It only works because such incidents are so rare. I can’t be effective in my job if I need to spend my time regulating and trying to modify the speech of my students.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*jlC1UcUP2nRoDODcyaMqpA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*w6GQuPbwx-_J58yrQfuj8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*jlC1UcUP2nRoDODcyaMqpA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*jlC1UcUP2nRoDODcyaMqpA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*jlC1UcUP2nRoDODcyaMqpA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*w6GQuPbwx-_J58yrQfuj8A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*w6GQuPbwx-_J58yrQfuj8A.png']",/@Bloomberg_Opinion?source=post_page---byline--400a94e474cb---------------------------------------

People created technology which fetched our current idea of digital, though we haven’t realized it yet. By using social networks, messengers, all online apps we have been partly showing our inner self to the others. Digital have just structured and focused it in one point or network node , if you will — our phone. Those tales about GDPR and other data protection measures tell us that our minds are no more privately closed as they used to be. Undoubtedly, IT giants have too much power over a steering wheel, however, being proactive subjects or passive stones it’s our choice to make.Below I figured out some rules we can use to collectively protect ourselves in the world of digital.
Renaissance philosopher Campanella wrote a book called “ The city of sun”. It’s known as the first utopia ever written. He’s managed to describe an ideal city from both ruling and living standpoints. Equal rights and wealth distribution, secure life, efficient work segmentation, self organization, deified humanity — these are main features of this clockwork-like divine city. Even though a prophetic start-up of Italian renaissance era have never been materialized , its idea permeated the minds of his followers (one of the most modern — was Jack Fresco). If fact, digital world created quite hostile environment for these ideas to find real life applications. In particular, online communities became , suffice to say, digital cities of sun. I wish Campanella could observe this. All in all, such an architecture can give us much more power than we’ve ever held in our collective hands.
Super-fast flow of information and world changing rate demands new through organization technics. By means of specific digital measures people can live an easier life by decreasing the informational load at least in half. This can be done by organizing your digital self.
Algorithms are cornerstones that software architects use to make us do what they will in response monetize: likes,shares and so on and so forth. They achieve it by exploiting our pscycological vulnerabilities. Intermittent variable rewards, sudo-free choice mechanisms, FOMSI(google it ), social approval , social awareness — these triggers of their digital guns aiming to confuse our minds. However, It have been not so clear that pretty anyone can operate this variables to digitally control oneself in one way or another.
Besides we all had our minds digitalized, as I wrote above, let me put it this way: digital makes shots from the parallel side of the mirror, when we are not seeing it. It’s a perfect way to reflect on what we are doing and self-monitor our lives: our bad or good habits, misdeeds. If we used it,we could, it term, easily draw conclusions of our doings. Moreover, these mirrors have an ability to save,on programmer’s slang, log files or, in other words, your activity. There is a saying:wise men learn by other men’s mistakes; fools by their own.In digital era we all have an opportunity to be wise — we only have to use it.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*-S-aI6R0tRs5eJF20zOyiw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*-S-aI6R0tRs5eJF20zOyiw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*-S-aI6R0tRs5eJF20zOyiw.jpeg']",/@dzen.fedor13?source=post_page---byline--e25e9df91d10---------------------------------------

Johnson & Johnson is using AI to help parentscustomize their child’s sleepcare. Unilever is trying to useblockchain to improve its ad buying.
But here’s the thing: adopting — and thensuccessfullyimplementing —innovative technologies requires more than just investing in robots, AI, and blockchain. It requires a fundamental understanding of the concepts and processes that have enabled tech companies to thrive and dominate the corporate landscape of today. For most old-school companies that were founded many decades ago, this often means reworking many of their core processes and fundamental beliefs.
Here are a few tech-pioneered concepts and processes which could prove particularly transformative for more traditional, less “tech” companies.
In many traditional industries — whether it’s restaurant supplies, TV advertising, or supplement manufacturing — it can take potential customersweeksto get a simple price quote for their order. You have to speak to multiple different reps (often telling them the same information), navigate opaque monopolistic supply chains, get multiple quotes to understand if you are being scammed or not, among other painful, mind-numbingly tedious tasks. To say the process is inefficient would be an understatement.

ByEvan DashevskyandJason Cohen
PCs, tablets, smartphones — even ourcoffee makers— can wirelessly connect to the internet at the push of a button, and devices buzz with emails, notifications, and status updates at all hours of the day. But it’s hard to imagine life without yourSamsung Galaxy Note 9orGoogle Pixel 3. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid some of these small irritations and make your day just a little bit calmer.
Here are some facts that should be completely unrelated: 1) AT&T is my wireless carrier. 2) AT&T owns DirecTV. 3) I am not a DirectTV subscriber. However, a DirecTV remote app came pre-installed on my phone. And I can’t delete it. Welcome to the world ofbloatware.
Bloatware is a blanket term used to describe pre-installed apps that take up space and resources on your phone. These apps — many of which you’ll never use — come courtesy of your phone’s manufacturer, carrier, and Google itself (plus a few licensed third-party apps thrown in for good measure). If you look through the apps on your phone, you’ll almost certainly find a bunch of apps you never downloaded and will never use. While bloatware is not unique to mobile devices, it’s most insidious on phones because of the limited computational resources, compared tothose on your home PC.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*swm7wm8KPci_e3AGjFZH4A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SLQXwWGHQ9WmCqtmk4Er4g.jpeg']",/@pcmagazine?source=post_page---byline--a5205ed8bbf6---------------------------------------

We gained valuable insight into marine conservation research and projects which brought fresh perspectives on how Last of Ours can bring fun and awareness to the masses to help protect wildlife and restore their habitats! Here are some highlights from our trip as well as the projects we had the pleasure of learning from.
🏝 The inauguralRotto Tech Festwas a full day onRottnest Islanddedicated to marine conservation and how technology is being used to collect, analyze, and interpret data. AsLast of Ourswill be referring to real-world data for our NFT species count and impact tracking, we were extremely excited to see the innovative techniques that researchers and engineers have come up with to study how we can best protect our planet’s marine species.
Did you know that columns of seawater contain valuable information about the species have passed through there? As marine animals move through the water, they leave a piece of their DNA behind via skin cells, scales, hair, excrement… you name it. Scientists have found a way to extract this DNA from water samples to analyze which species had been there. The DNA isolated and characterised from sediments and water is calledenvironmental DNA. eDNA can give us a glimpse of biodiversity, food web dynamics, diet analysis and invasive species monitoring.
🔬 First described in 2012, the use of eDNA in water was demonstrated as an example to characterise vertebrates living in the sample. Since then, numerous studies have emerged to investigate the potential of this approach inbiosecurityandbiodiversity assessments.MetabarcodingeDNA has become feasible thanks to the ability to simultaneously sequence millions of copies of DNA from complex multi-species environmental samples.
Professor Mike Bunce, head ofthe Trace and environmental DNA (TrEnD) laboratorypresented his lab’s work at Rottnest to showcase the strides they have made thanks to this technique. They also have a partner program with other research labs to integrate baited remote underwater video (BRUV) technologies and eDNA as a cutting-edge tool to give us insights into how we can best manage various marine ecosystems.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*mVfVNqFraOFqcGxunV89Nw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SY_N8Z_MzZXonIsLnGa4ag.jpeg']",/@nichanank?source=post_page---byline--e075aacfd8c---------------------------------------

That’s how long recent estimates suggest it would take in some developing countries to legally register all land — due to the limited number of land surveyors in country and the use of outdated, cumbersome, costly, and overly regulated surveying and registration procedures.
But I am convinced that the target of registering all land can be achieved — faster and cheaper. This is an urgent need in Africa whereless than 10% of all landis surveyed and registered, as this impacts securing land tenure rights for both women and men — a move that canhave a greater effecton household income, food security, and equity.
The question remains, how can we register land and secure tenure at scale?Perhaps one of our answers can be found in rural Tanzania where I recently witnessed the use of a mobile surveying and registration application. In several villages, USAID and the government of Tanzania are piloting the use of theMobile Application to Secure Tenure(MAST), one of several (open-source) applications available on the market. DFID, SIDA, and DANIDA are supporting a similar project.
The process of mobile land surveying and registration goes like this:
Technology truly reduces the barriers to entry as it enables the participation of all community members– from the initial informational meeting to the confirmation of boundaries with neighbors, or as part of the team handling the application. Perhaps what was even more encouraging was the inclusion of youths and women in the teams, as they are often not given access to land and participation in land-related discussions in patriarchal societies and customary contexts.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*DUcNya6Vdb53pUdgO20d2g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*3WqurZfz0AgdVeO6IIk7ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*3WqurZfz0AgdVeO6IIk7ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*3WqurZfz0AgdVeO6IIk7ig.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*DUcNya6Vdb53pUdgO20d2g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*DUcNya6Vdb53pUdgO20d2g.png']",/@WorldBank?source=post_page---byline--fe38e2a179e2---------------------------------------

Cook', 'No responses yet']",,2 min read,Jeremy S. Cook,"As spotted on Reddit, the creator of this perfboard clock notes that one can lose track of time when working at your computer for extended hours. While thereisnormally a little clock in one corner of your screen, more than likely you fail to look at it, and whenever your eyes wander off-screen to — you know, stare off into space — that little clock is nowhere to be found in your line of sight.
To help with this very modern problem, theTime ‘O’ Time clock was designedusing six 8-segment bubble display modules, vaguely reminiscent of miniature Nixie tubes. The assembly is creatively soldered on a pair of perfboards, sandwiched together via header pins that allow for disassembly as needed. Power is supplied through the USB port of a laptop computer when used as intended, although any USB power source would also suffice. When disconnected, time is preserved using a CR3032 battery, so it doesn’t have to be reset ever time it’s plugged in.
An ATmega 8L chip controls the clock, which keeps track of time using an internal oscillator. While this gives a reasonable accuracy of +/- 8 seconds per day, the project write-up mentions that it would have been better to use an external crystal for this duty. If and when it does need to be reset, each of the hh/mm/ss digits has its own dedicated button, which should make setting the time convenient when needed.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*S1w2rSkxZKk3TeoZmIzYlQ.jpeg']",/@JeremySCook?source=post_page---byline--4ed9c4bb4f2b---------------------------------------

But, while they can range in price anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, a large percentage use the same controller chips. Timo Birnschein’s Acton Blink Qu4tro is a fairly high end model, but that controller meant the remote was still frustrating to use. So,Birnschein designed his own open source remote.
Birnschein’s Open esk8 Remote works with anyelectric skateboardthat uses the nRF24L01+ chip for wireless communication — which is probably most of them. It addresses many of the frustrations found in OEM remotes included with these mass-produced electric skateboards, including better battery life indicators, improved throttle control, and more consistent communication. It also feels a lot more solid, which is an important consideration for a device like this.
Inside Birnschein’s remote isan Arduino Nano, an nRF24L01+ breakout board, a DC/DC converter board, a throttle potentiometer, a power switch, LEDs, micro switches, a buzzer, and 2 AAA batteries. To build this, you’ll needa 3D printerfor the body of the remote. To make the PCB you’ll need a small mill, or you can simply send the design out for professional fabrication.

Something about the bright, flashing colors just makes electronic dance music all the more fun to bop along to — or however you’re supposed to dance these days. Breakdancing or something, maybe? Anyway, if that’s your thing,Amy Goodchild’s awesome tutorialwill walk you through how to build an interactive FadeCandy LED dome that’s perfect for your next dance party.
When in Domeis a 4.2 meter (about 14 foot) geodesic dome with the interior covered in 4,378 individually-addressable LEDs. I imagine that dancing inside the dome probably makes one feel like they’ve been transported into a David Guettamusic video. Goodchild designed and builtWhen in Domeas the final project for her Master’s degree in Design for Performance and Interactive at the Interactive Architecture Lab of the University College London Bartlett School of Architecture.
Goodchild has also made the plans available, so you can build your own! The structure of the geodesic dome is constructed using a hub kit fromBuild with Hubs, which is designed specifically to be easy to assemble. The finished dome is made up of 33 triangular panels, and those are split into 11 sets of three panels each. Each set of three gets 512 LEDs and oneAdafruit FadeCandy LED controller.
Programming the LED controllers is where it gets quite complicate, but Goodchild provides a thorough explanation. The FadeCandy server needs to be setup with an accurate map of the LED layout, which is handled by a dymaxion map that unfolds the 3D shape into a 2D surface map.

During the early ages of Android customization, SuperSU was the popular way of gaining root access. Basically, Root access enables one to not only access the system files lying at the so-called “Root” of the OS but also modify them.
It’s a magic tool to customize, tweak, tamper the OS of an android device to get the best out of it by acquiring root permissions. Magisk not only grants root access but also has various features like systemless root and different modules. Magisk can be well defined as “A Magic mask to Alter System Sytemlessly. ” Some of the key features and modules are explained below:
It’s a feature which allows system modification without notifying the system. Magisk stores modifications in the boot partition instead of modifying the real system files. OS doesn’t detect any tampering and unaware about modifications which makes the Magisk obscure to the system.
The “Systemless” method makes it possible. Nowadays many developers useGoogleSafetyNetfeature to detect the System modifications so that some actions can be performed for example apps like Google pay app and Netflix uses it to detect and restrict rooted devices from accessing the app.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*3ykJXFDSkdH3MJeeb4tznQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*3ykJXFDSkdH3MJeeb4tznQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*3ykJXFDSkdH3MJeeb4tznQ.jpeg']",/@droidverine?source=post_page---byline--81abd63ea63d---------------------------------------

It was December 21, 2018, just days before holiday celebrations, when Electrum developers received a screenshot that had been making the rounds in a German chat room. Depicted was an error message one user had received when sending a transaction, but something about the message wasn’t adding up to developers, since it directed users to what was discovered to be a malicious GitHub repository with a malware version of wallet.
According to SomberNight the user who received this error message was likely using a legitimate Electrum client, but connected to a maliciously operated Electrum server when they attempted to broadcast a transaction. When the transaction couldn’t resolve, the client displayed the user the malicious error message, which directed them to install malware that would have prompt users to enter and subsequently steal any private keys.
In order to increase their chances of intercepting transactions from clients the attacker created multiple servers in what is commonly referred to as a sybil attack. The rich text error message users who connected to the malicious servers received is a throwback to bitcoin dev code where it was used to report back errors to users like low incremental fee, missing inputs, or other issues could crop up.
Once the team caught wind of the attack a patch (3.3.2) was issued to the client but it was not a long term solution, as SomberNight explained: “This is not a true fix, but the more proper fix of using error codes would entail upgrading the whole federated server ecosystem out there…”","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eLJFM8Rb4sj9C8aPmng14g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*HNERNezBCO7hj7W-.jpg']",/@ETH_Nation?source=post_page---byline--4d36e3afb747---------------------------------------

The problem with this approach is that Homebrew's OpenMPI formula is not versioned. Therefore, anytime you update/upgrade your Homebrew's formulae, then you'll get a new version.
You can selectively upgrade the formulae you want, and stick to an OpenMPI version as long as you wish, but what if you want a specific version? you cannot do that.
Developers using OpenMPI usually run their jobs in a High Performance Computing (HPC for short) cluster. These kinds of clusters are not upgraded as soon as someone releases a new OpenMPI version.
It happened that the HPC cluster I work with is 2 or 3 versions behind the OpenMPI latest release. When administrators finally upgrade the version, then I need to tweak my local OpenMPI formula and point to an older version. That's not trivial. The only way to do that is looking at full commit history of thehomebrew-coreproject, identify the commit where the version has been upgraded, replace the local formula, and then deal with merge conflicts whenever you issuebrew update.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png']",/@_carlosm?source=post_page---byline--ca2c79470c70---------------------------------------

Here, in part 2, Michelle Warbis considers how technology can facilitate increased consumer activity, before outlining InLinkUK’s contribution to reviving high streets.
How can technology be harnessed to help — increasing economic activity
Encouraging people to high streets is only half the story. Once people are on a high street, the value of their spend and activity, and its impact on local economic growth cannot be underestimated. The further use of technology on our high streets has an important part to play in increasing this much needed commercial activity.
A study by staff at New York University, Future Cities Catapult and Center for Inclusive Growth, found that occurrences of on-street technology — specifically the Links deployed by LinkNYC in partnership with the City of New York — seemed to create uplift on surrounding commercial activity. The study notes that in areas of Brooklyn where Links have been deployed, there was an average uplift of 2.4% in retail transactional activity in surrounding businesses, something they note to be reasonably significant. The same study found that the presence of bike-sharing tech in Jersey City increased business in nearby food establishments by around 4%. Whilst more work is required in understand the reasons for this uplift, the statistics are encouraging.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*koeq-xdZQ-xP_z1PzCm5_Q.jpeg']",/@InLinkUK?source=post_page---byline--5192451a7859---------------------------------------

Well, before we go deeper into comprehending blockchain, let’s understand what Bitcoin is.
Based on the years' old concept of cryptography, Satoshi Nakamoto (an unidentified individual or group of people) wrote a whitepaper for Bitcoin that was published in 2008. He had successfully created a system that would go on to show the world a financial system that negates the use of all kinds of intermediaries.
Bitcoin has two parts: Bitcoin token and Bitcoin ledger/blockchain.
So, yes, Bitcoin was the first ever blockchain to be developed and put to use along with its own cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

This may be a convenient storage method, but when playing music takes up both hands, it’s a bit inconvenient to reach over and swipe the screen. To help his musician brother out with this conundrum, hacker “mosivers” came up with awireless foot pedal for turning pages.
He first attempted to spoof a capacitive input on the Kindle’s touchscreen, but after some initial success, he found this method to be impractical, and decided to instead go the Wi-Fi route. This involved first jailbreaking the Kindle, then installing several pieces of software and creating a page flip script to be executed remotely.
After all of that preparatory work, it was time to build the physical unit. It uses a NodeMCUESP8266dev board to generate a web server, which allows for linking between the two devices without any intermediate Wi-Fi connection. The programmed board was then secured in an enclosure in order to hold up repeated toe taps, with a pair of buttons used for changing the page.

Their first-of-its-kind, patent-pending Coral Manta system constantly “watches” and detects movement in private pools using a built-in underwater video camera, computer vision and artificial intelligence technology.
When it identifies a potential drowning situation, it sounds an ear-piercing alarm and immediately sends a smartphone alert to all household members.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*jdSZPuoorbqSlB8NDAWaew.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*JjU3aec7CcnoHGay4pqR1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*JjU3aec7CcnoHGay4pqR1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*JjU3aec7CcnoHGay4pqR1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*jdSZPuoorbqSlB8NDAWaew.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*jdSZPuoorbqSlB8NDAWaew.png']",/@Jerusalem_Post?source=post_page---byline--37159c06d153---------------------------------------

Maybe it’s me, but when I see something like:
I can’t help but think that’s but one part of the story, and maybe not even the most important part of the story.[1]This chart is of one output — but what about the other inputs and outputs?
Generally, ML and particularly neural nets are ravenous beasts. Inputs include large amounts of data and hefty doses of power. This may seem trivial but recall than when the world went crypto-crazy a year ago, entire countries noted the power-usage spikes. That’s loads of powerful GPUs causing energy spikes on a national level. It’s not trivial. (This reminds me of Obama’s big EV push that established committees to review grid/power issues but no significant power-infrastructure investments — that’s how you knew they weren’t serious. Millions of EVs on the road … .where was the power going to come from?)
Anyway, compared to humans, computers are remarkably inefficient — with both data and power. Humans can supplement inadequate data with imagination (I suppose one could draw an analogy to regressions, but computers fill-in-the-blanks poorly compared to humans and still require much more data). And the human brain is remarkably energy efficient.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*RaMDL72qiRJFxtjpnPTTtg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*RaMDL72qiRJFxtjpnPTTtg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*RaMDL72qiRJFxtjpnPTTtg.png']",/?source=post_page---byline--17581d235ece---------------------------------------

I’ve always been fascinated by how they think and what drives them to create and innovate. How is it that they see things most people do not? What might seem mundane to us could seem profitable to them. What can we learn from how they think and how they see the world?
One of the innovators I look up to is Casey Neistat — an American film director, producer, and popular YouTube creator. He said,“If the reason why you’re doing something creative is to make a living, then you are doing it wrong. You get into it because it’s your passion and it’s something that you really believe in.”What I got from this is that the art of innovation starts with the aspiration to make a difference as opposed to profitable gain. Creating purpose means that you can and are changing the world. However, if you do happen to change the world, you would also likely be earning from it. But if it’s the other way around, if you start off with the sole desire to make money, you probably won’t make money — you won’t even change the world. The truth is, you would likely fail. So, determining how you can find meaning and how you can change the world would greatly increase your chances of success.
Let’s take a look at some of today’s leading innovators and how their products made a difference — Apple, Google, and YouTube. Apple wanted to make computers accessible — they wanted to bring computing power to everyone; Google wanted to make information available to everyone; and YouTube wanted to enable people to create videos and make it easily available to everyone. These companies started by wanting to make a difference. Today, they are already very successful in their respective fields and are changing the world as we know it.
Another lesson we can learn from innovators is the ability to see what others cannot and be the first to jump the curve. Let’s have another look at two successful startups in history — Uber and AirBnb. These companies have revolutionized the fields of transportation and travel by harnessing the power of technology. How? They simply saw the idea of “sharing” and how it could take over their industries like nobody ever did and capitalized on it through the use of available technology. They have challenged traditional industries through the apps they have created and have since reduced customer journey steps, making everything easier and faster. These tech titans, now recognized as “killer companies”, radically changed the game and are now changing the world. It’s a matter of perspective — not getting stuck in a stagnant or comfortable state by being smart and finding better ways. I guess most successful innovators are not waiting for progress; they are a little bit forward-leaning by trying to make progress happen.
To create is to innovate and to innovate is to improve what’s already been built. In a time wherein there’s already someone, somewhere who has created what you thought was unique, you have to see things in a different perspective in order to be successful. Have what it takes to be a creator — find an idea and build on it. Once you find your passion for creating, who knows? You could be the next big content creator or CEO of a startup company! Just make sure that you take that first step towards your goal.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Sl0YyQ9d4hmd2gxE-zSe0Q.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*thyg1t0M8qAyTc88_yPjaw.jpeg']",/@iamsimone02?source=post_page---byline--93c2829dae59---------------------------------------

I’m looking forward to it!
CES gets close to 200,000 attendees and thousands of exhibits spread out over multiple venues. My first visit, the wait for the taxi line was over an hour even though the ride was 12 minutes. The wait to getoutof the cab at the venue was another 10 minutes. Fortunately, Uber has cut down the wait time and it’s maybe 30 minutes to get from the airport to the venues.
Of course, getting between the main venues can also be a wait. For the five minute drive between the Sands Expo and the LVCC and the one time I decided to take the shuttle, it was over an hour to get from point to point. Walking for about 30 minutes door to door is the most reliable way. I had seen nearly a 6x Uber surge in between meetings.
Over time, I learned how to pack lighter for CES and hone the schedule. Here’s some distilled knowledge:
Last year, I had 30 meetings setup over 36 hours and either I or the other party was late about 70% of the time, cascading into being late for the next meeting. Follow up from CES can also be difficult. You wait a few days for everyone to get back home and then the excitement of whatever was presented in the meeting is muted.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*M7NMMU-lA5c47fHsm46e1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*pKOfOAOvx-fWzfITATgGRg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*M7NMMU-lA5c47fHsm46e1w.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*M7NMMU-lA5c47fHsm46e1w.jpeg']",/@grebler?source=post_page---byline--abd2b189d3d9---------------------------------------

We have witnessed first-hand a shift in attitudes as the sector has realised data science is becoming no longer a luxury but a necessity. Its application is unquestionably challenging marketing to be more data-driven than ever before. Here are some reflections on 2018 and predictions for this year:
Measurement is still critical
The size of the prize in data-driven attribution and measurement in 2019 is huge, for two standout reasons. Firstly, an opportunity: data can now be collected and analysed at a scale that enables a better understanding of the customer and their path to purchase than ever before. Secondly, the problem: the same driver of the opportunity in data is resulting in a rate of evolution in AdTech and MarTech with which most marketers can’t keep up. Each new technology, channel or tool adopted creates its own data silo and increases the gap to a holistic understanding of the customer.
For these reasons, we believe measurement and attribution are the necessary enabler for data-driven decision making in every facet of marketing. Forrester’s Wave supports this, showing that marketers are increasingly calling for measurement tools that can help them deliver content that effectively targets individual customers. Fortunately, the expectation for what data-science and AI can deliver here are starting to be matched by the reality.
Not only will a data-driven approach increase the ROI of emerging channels but it has also been proven to renew the effectiveness of traditional ones in 2018. The remarkable resurgence ofbillboard advertisinghas been driven to a large extent by the fact that the channel has ‘progressed to the point where advertisers can now track nearly all of the same metrics with a billboard as they can with a digital ad’. It’s a fascinating story of how data and measurement have resurrected a ‘relic of the past’ and opened up exciting opportunities for marketers.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*iKAg9m-AuZT3nfCFoIXjaQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*iKAg9m-AuZT3nfCFoIXjaQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*iKAg9m-AuZT3nfCFoIXjaQ.jpeg']",/@wearefospha?source=post_page---byline--a80c58e6f8b0---------------------------------------

With 3.196 billion social media users globally, according to the Global Digital Report 2018 and an avalanche of new social media platforms being churned out daily, it is no surprise, the average person in the world spends 2 hours and 15 minutes every day on social media, that is, one out of every three minutes spent online.
While the attention span of today’s users dropped to 8 seconds in 2018, it is crucial for brands to build their social media marketing plans/goals for the new year with this in mind.
Without further ado, here are my social media marketing predictions for 2019:
1) Artificial Intelligence: It is estimated that the Compound Annual Growth Rate of AI’s adoption in the social media industry will be over 30% by 2023. AI solutions consists of technologies collaborating to find connections within enormous data sets (synonymously known as Big Data). As it pertains to social media marketing, current AI tools are highly valuable for content creation, strategic planning and reporting.
Chat bots and virtual assistants have become increasingly ubiquitous, but this is only the beginning. In the future, chat bots will use “colloquial APIs” to respond to customers queries in a more human-like form. Currently, the automated service revolution has become prevalent in e-commerce sites and on messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*2mBCfRUpdSYRuf9EKnhTDQ.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*PjZPUyl_rMCfplHI3SdDJg.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@rachael.u.bassey?source=post_page---byline--7c227a78e6ce---------------------------------------

I mostly read fiction, but nevertheless I would read often. However, with the greater penetration of technology and social media into my life, my reading hobby died down to a point where it was merely a chore I did for school. Although I wasn’t reading, I still developed my passion for science and technology and improved my knowledge in these areas through sources like YouTube videos, blog posts and articles.
But during the summer of 2018, I realized something: compared to YouTube videos, blog posts and articles, the quality and quantity of the content in books are at a different level. A YouTuber at most will spend a few days working on scripting, shooting and editing a video. Similarly a short blog post or article won’t take more than a few days of work. But a book takes years of planning, writing, and editing to get published. Also, whilst anyone with an internet connection can upload a YouTube video or write a blog post, a book goes through a huge amount of quality control before it’s published. After understanding the relative value of books as a medium to grow my knowledge and understanding of technology, I decided to start reading regularly again and set myself the goal of reading a book each week or 25 books before the end of 2018.
By today, the 1st of January 2019, I’ve read 23/25 books, which I’m pretty happy with. Over the course of these 6 months and 23 books, I learnt a huge amount and I also feel that I have grown more as a person. Of course not all 23 books taught me a lot and had a great impact on me, but the following 15 books did. I have ordered them from least to most impactful and shared a bit of information about each book and the lessons I learnt from each of them.
I picked up this book purely because I was familiar with Sinek and his idea of Starting with Why and its effect on an audience. I first watched Simon Sinek’sTed Talk, Start with Why,around the beginning of middle school, and it has shaped the structure of my writing, speaking and thinking processes. “Start with Why” builds on the idea of the golden circle that’s brought up in the Ted Talk. However, in addition to focusing on the power of “Starting with Why” as a communication tool, Sinek illustrated a variety of examples to emphasize the importance of having a why and shaping one’s day to day activities around this why. He explains that be it an organization or an individual, progress requires a clear understanding of why they get out of bed every morning.
Although I’m not a big fan of soccer, I picked up this book because I am a fan of Mathematics and Data Science. In Soccermatics, David Sumpter uses a lot of match data coupled with mathematical reasoning and analysis techniques to explore the math behind various aspects of football: from formations to bicycle kicks. He also uses match data and a bit of Machine Learning to predict future match results, which he then put to the test by betting on them. Though Sumpter’s explanations were a bit boring at times, some results were quite interesting and I found it really interesting how Math can be applied to almost anything- even football.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*QlJSUnhdGgTrVzQpre9bPA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*QlJSUnhdGgTrVzQpre9bPA.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*QlJSUnhdGgTrVzQpre9bPA.jpeg']",/@anudaweerasinghe?source=post_page---byline--1d6e0ee1f848---------------------------------------

The challenges they seem to encounter in different markets makes it a very interesting company to watch and the unique solutions they often come up to better adapt to local conditions, at-least in my eyes, show why they are a market leader in the transportation industry. At this stage I believe their strategy has evolved to trying to become a marketplace for transportation that gets you from point A to point B regardless of the mode of transportation. So be it through an electric scooter or a bus, the vision is that Uber would be the go to platform to get such transportation.
What I find quite intriguing and inline with the aforementioned strategy is the recent launch of Uber Bus in Egypt and how a similar initiative would be aptly suited for the Southern African market. As someone who has studied, worked and lived in South Africa I understand that the impact of such a launch on the South African market would be significant to say the least.
Close to 70% of all private transportation of individuals is through the minibus taxi industry. These minibus taxis are largely informal, have a designated route and pick up people from anywhere between the point where the route begins and where it ends. Customers pay in cash and taxis often drive recklessly and take detours to compete for clients, making it difficult for passengers to predict arrival times. People use this as a mode of transportation for everyday travel for both leisure and getting to and from work. According to the South African National Taxi Council, taxis transport about 15 million commuters daily, if we assume the average fare is R15 (thumb-suck) then we can put the size of the industry at around R82 billion. Assuming a smartphone penetration of 35% (Pew Research puts it at 51%, but the numbers could be skewed by smartphone users who have more than one smartphone) this would put the total addressable market for ride hailing in the taxi industry at around R28.4 billion (5.2 million commuters a day), presenting an obviously an amazing opportunity for Uber or any other player with the gall and capital to invest in an Uber Taxi type alternative.
Understandably one of the biggest concerns with trying to step into the taxi industry’s turf is the likely backlash from the taxi industry. Historically, the launching of transportation options that potentially disrupt the taxi industry has created a lot of friction that has manifested in the form of violence. In many cases this has been averted through partnerships with the Taxi industry. Projects such as the MyCiti (bus rapid transit service in Cape Town) and the Gautrain averted these issues by through dialogue with taxi associations. For example, the launch of MyCiti in Cape Town involved Transport for Cape Town (TCT) buying out operating permits for taxi drivers operating in the City Bowl area with drivers receiving significant payouts as a result of this, limited permit buyouts in townships. This model drastically reduced potential conflict.
Similarly, Uber/Taxify could approach the matter by looking to form a partnership with a select few Taxi companies that operate routes and has taxis that are in excellent condition in areas that are suburban areas or areas close to the metropolitan that are more heavily populated with working age middle-class demographics (according to FNB’s retail segment data this includes anyone earning a gross salary of between R7000 — R60000 per month) that are heavily populated with the objective of targeting the market segment that lies in the middle-class, uses taxis to get to work and have access to both a smartphone and a bank account. I would assume that this is the demographic that would most likely already know the brand, have a high smartphone penetration and a higher employment rate (they need to get to work on a daily basis).","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*BuF0FIW2pncTz-XEkHn3-Q.jpeg']",/@emmanuelsibanda?source=post_page---byline--c1872b2b239a---------------------------------------

Cracked phone screen? Worst thing ever. Hard drive corrupted? Day ruined. We rely more heavily on our technology each and every day. My devices are a part of me and have attached themselves at my hip for more reasons than one.
Full disclosure, I’ve had Apple devices for the last 7 years, andI just recently purchased a new iPhone. When Apple released the first iPhone nearly 12 years ago, they kickstarted a new platform and method of keeping their customer base from switching to any other device, convenience.
We constantly look for convenience in everyday life, which trains to take to work, ordering food ahead, or basically anyone who has an Amazon Prime account. Apple has captured that idea in every product they’ve released in the last decade preventing users from going to their competitors.
Timeout, let’s be clear, there is actually nothing preventing one Apple customer from a switch to say, a Samsung device or the new Google Pixel 3. For the most part, there are extremely capable and much more affordable devices out there without a fruit logo that will do just fine. But Apple does it’s best to bring you in as a user once and knows that it likely won’t have to do much to keep you there.
Unbox Therapymentioned this recently while discussing the limitations Apple has created for itself in Asian markets with no “budget” smartphone options. Apple customers are stuck on that early innovation that Apple found in the early 2000s. They are still riding on that iTunes, iPod, original iPhone wave that has led us to devices like the iPhone XS and the iPad Pro.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*_ddlkUfTcvEkvmxL.jpg']",/@BSzabo24?source=post_page---byline--296b3d00fe49---------------------------------------
https://medium.com/@trkkmlynk/how-touchscreens-work-1b2d9a995c4b?source=tag_archive---------130-----------------------,How touchscreens work,['Written by Tarık'],1,4 min read,Tarık,"Did you know that there is 7 types of touchscreens?
A touchscreen has the ability to detect a touch within the given display area. It is made up of 3 basic elements, a sensor, a controller and a software driver. All the variants of touchscreen technology carry their own distinctive characteristics, with individual benefits and limitations.
If you push your finger on the screen and it collapses slightly, then it means it’s resistive. And you’re in big trouble. There are two plates under the screen that are not too close but not too far to each other and a continuous electric current passes through them. When you press your finger on the screen above, the two plates touch each other(not in an NSFW way) and the electric current at that point changes. And after that, the software does its job.
These types of phones don’t care what type of pressure you apply, they work on their own. If you don’t believe me, go ahead, buy one. These phones don’t care about you so much that they have the possibility of sending love letters to your crush on their own. Stay a mile away from these.

Blockchain, in its crude form, is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) whose append-only nature provides a robust mechanism to store data in data blocks. These blocks are linked cryptographically via hash functions, making it virtually impossible to change data of a particular block without disturbing the rest of the block sequence that followed. Simply put, it’s like a growing set of public record that carries a possibility to disrupt multiple industries and streamline their business operations.

Itwas the year that technology — and the people who create it — seemingly could do no right, and did much that was wrong. As one of my sources put it in a tweet reacting to a dumb tech stunt, “2018 can’t end soon enough.”

We live in a hyperconnected generation in which we have the ability to contact another person instantaneously, whether he lives five minutes or five hours from us. The internet is a platform for unique individuals to relate to users who share common interests or hobbies. It is a place to stay informed about current events. It is a scaffold where human beings can learn, watch, or read about any topic they desire. Nevertheless, as the internet becomes increasingly accessible around the globe — connecting billions of strangers — users tend to put their best faces forward, concealing the reality of the somber emotions behind it. Sadly, this is one explanation as to why depression and suicide rates are higher than ever.
With each new application on the market that promises happiness amongst users, society is being deceived into becoming more and more addicted to their phones. This sport, which consists of scrolling and streaming, spurs isolation from friends and family; thus leaving the most important type of connections — human interactions — as one of our lowest priorities. Between 2010 and 2016 the number of adolescents who suffered major episodes of depression and loneliness increased by 60%. This considerable growth can be attributed to the enslavement teens feel towards their phones since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, Facebook in 2004, Instagram in 2010, Twitter in 2006, and Snapchat in 2011. Our overwhelming obsession with posting, liking, and scrutinizing every moment has gotten out of control. The new reality is that instead of watching concerts, we record them; in place of eating delicious meals, we photograph them; rather than joking with our friends, we tag them. Ultimately, we prefer to view life rather than experience it.
As a teenager, I constantly hear my parents reminisce about the times they would play outside until sundown, only returning home to eat at the dinner table with their own parents. This may seem like a cheesy scene out of an old movie, but devoting time to spend with family (a tradition that many have given up on) used to be an integral part of many children’s lives. Research from the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that teens who allocate quality time for their families tend to lead happier lives. Despite this fact, young adults consistently give up sharing stories at the dinner table in favor of locking themselves in a dark room and binging-watching Netflix shows. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide rates for white and black children between the ages 10 and 17 have increased by 70% and 77%, respectively, between 2006 and 2016. Unfortunately, our generation withholds the knowledge necessary to take action and stop trends similar to these from developing, but we don’t know how to enforce it.
What should be a simple task — setting down our devices and seeing the world with our own two eyes — isn’t as straightforward as it seems. Tech gurus specialize in pumping out new games and features that light up our reward centers, making it feel artificially good for us to zone into the harsh fluorescent screen. Yet, it is these Silicon Valley innovators who find themselves instituting tech-free homes for the sake of their children’s health and happiness. If the experts are also the ones who most fear the internet’s vast capabilities, shouldn’t that be a clear warning to change our habits?
We used a tool designed to enhance our well being to aid in our mental destruction. It is our obligation to resist the seclusion of the omnipresent cyberworld so we do not miss out on the lives we deserve.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*bYr2D-7UM6IrN9ry.jpg']",/@serena.golden_17349?source=post_page---byline--f5d9b21f3c6a---------------------------------------

Necessary for the distributed ledger to function is ensuring the entire network of participants collectively agree with the terms of the contract. The purpose of the consensus is to verify the validity of the information being added to the ledger, to prevent double spending and other invalid data from being appended to the blockchain and to keep the network from being derailed through forking. There are a number of different consensus mechanisms out there. The most popular are the Proof of Work and Proof of Stake systems. All of them aim to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem but none of them provide a perfect solution.
What is the Byzantine Generals’ Problem
The definition of the Byzantine Generals’ Problem is bestdefined on CoinCentralas “a term etched from the computer science description of a situation where involved parties must agree on a single strategy in order to avoid complete failure, but where some of the involved parties are corrupt and disseminating false information or are otherwise unreliable.”
The Byzantine armies surround a city, ready to invade but they need to attack at the same time. The city is not strong enough to fight back against the entire Byzantine army. But the Byzantine army will only win if they attack at the same time. To make a decision, the generals of each army have to send a messenger back and forth to deliver the message. If the messenger gets caught or sends the wrong message, the Byzantine army will fail. There is no way to guarantee the authenticity of the message. How do they create a trustless system that ensures victory in attacking the city?

Both heavy smoking, and more recentlylow-intensity smokinghave been linked to increased occurrences of death in various populations.
It has also been said that “sitting is the new smoking”, that sedentary behavior is just as bad for one’s health. Internal studies conducted by our data science team have shown that sitting, is actually in fact worse. Vivametrica’s founders have been studying the effects of physical activity on health and chronic disease for over 20 years, this research has been the basis of our proprietary risk analytics. More interest in studying the impact of sedentary behavior on human health has arisen. Sedentary behavior has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in patients withChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Another study, which looked at the combined effects of watching TV with smoking found these factors to be co-morbid incancer-related mortality.
Vivametrica conducted a study using 10-year mortality data to compare our risk prediction model to a traditional insurance risk model (>2000 person sample). The initial data sample, including wearable device data, was collected 10 years ago. As part of this study, we also performed individual variable assessments to determine the effects of specific factors on mortality.
Steps-per-day (habitual physical activity) was the strongest predictor of mortality. Individuals who took fewer steps than the average for their age and gender were 5.4x more likely to die after 10 years compared to those who took more steps. When we looked at smoking status alone, we found that smokers were 1.2x more likely to die after 10 years compared to non-smokers. From these results, it can be said that physical activity has a greater impact on overall all-cause mortality than smoking in this study. Thus, increasing efforts to modify sedentary behavior with smoking cessation can help people to live longer. Getting people to move more seems to have an even bigger impact than stopping cigarette use.

DApps are not owned by anyone, they run on the blockchain, and technically their backend code is running on a decentralized P2P network.
Crypto pundits and the community defined criteria that a DApp needs to meet in order to be considered the obvious, a decentralized app. First, it must be open source and the source code of the app to be available to all network participants, and anyone can check and contribute to the code. Secondly, it has to use blockchain technology to record transactions which anyone can refer to at any given point. Thirdly, it needs to be fueled by tokens or digital assets. Lastly, it needs to generate tokens and have an inbuilt consensus mechanism like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
DApps propose a paradigm shift in the way we view software models. A world running on decentralized apps will be remapping the technological landscape. Why? Just because they are distributed, transparent and incentivized mechanisms open to all network users. The increasing development of DApps has opened up the possibility of an exciting new world, dominated by decentralized gaming apps likeCryptoRome,Endless DiceandSteem Monstersas well as token exchanges such asIDEX,BancorandKyber.
On the contrary, not all crypto space-related apps survive or end up delivering on their technological ambitions. Although, the crypto environment has given a plethora of ICOs and ideas, over time these have faded. After the 2017–2018 hype in new ICOs, only few of the original and innovative projects survived. As we move into 2019, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done as the majority of DApps do not, yet, appeal to the vast majority of people.

Yunphant Blockchain — Yu Zhibei: Blockchain solves e-commerce pain points in four ways
On Friday December 28, Yu Zhibei, the co-founder of Yunphant Blockchain, was invited to participate in the 23rd issue of “Hangzhou E-commerce Innovation and Entrepreneurship Salon” sponsored by Hangzhou Municipal Council of Commerce, bringing a wonderful theme “Blockchain Best Practice”. Mr Yu had panel discussion about the topic of “E-commerce cross-border blockchain; Application scene iteration and upgrade” with other experts and audiences, and made in-depth analysis of the blockchain in the specific e-commerce scenarios. He believes that e-commerce can open up information flow, logistics and capital flow by implementing blockchain technology. Through the cooperation based on trust, optimize the upstream and downstream relationship of the industry chain, so that the synergy between the participants is more efficient and low-cost.

What about back-end ? Without browser, how JavaScript is executed ?
So it’s time to learn Node.js !
Node.jsis a program allowing you to run JavaScript outside of browser. It means that if you install Node.js, you can run JavaScript on your PC, on your server.Technically, Node.js is built with Chrome’s V8 engine which is written in C++.

On the other hand, it seems like we are headed towards another recession. How will the gig economy react in this mist of all this?
Even though, some experts say that recession could go in favor of the gig world as more and more people will see it as a necessity to pick up gigs and make extra income.

Grandparents would read books and newspapers, all being beneficial to the to the mind. Now, people will stare at a cell phone; reading what they see on social media, becoming highly influenced by mythical statements created only to play devils advocate with whomever they please for attention. The effects of AI or technology is creating psychological disabilities beginning with millennial's and spreading throughout other generations. millennial's grew up with easy access to technology such as smartphones and mobile laptops, thus becoming part of their everyday life. That created anxiety, depression, and shortening attention spans. Technology is becoming a toxic innovation to the growing society weakening morals and sensitivity to violent acts towards people.
Living in a world where technology does not exist is nearly impossible. A day without an alarm clock, cell phone, or computers has become unfathomable to adolescents. Essentially, the pace of technological advances has immensely increased over the last few decades to ease our lives and provide us more opportunities. It is undeniable that technology has changed our lives, tech critics argue that the Internet and other related technological gadgets have a deleterious effect on the human brain performance . However, tech critics only see one side of technology and neglect to mention the new intelligence that technologies have brought us. Furthermore, the existence of technology has made an incredible difference in the generation we live in by transforming global development, improving people’s lives and sparking innovation. A well-known professor from California State University named Larry Rosen, has created a correlated term to use for the diagnosis he calls an iDisorder. An iDisorder is where you exhibit signs and symptoms of a psychiatric disorder such as OCD, narcissism, addiction or even ADHD, which are manifested through your use — or overuse — of technology.
Nicholas Carr is a brilliant writer who strongly believes and has a firm vision of the internet’s neurological effect on the brain. Throughout his article, “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” he feels that “the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle” due to the rise of the internet. Carr reflects on his own experience of his years spent online and blames the internet for being the reason why he tends to get “fidgety” after two or three pages. He makes a big assumption that the internet is responsible for the rest of the society’s declined critical thinking. The dynamic of the internet alone demands the technique of skimming, we are losing the ability to read deeply and, by implication, to think deeply. Adolescents whom grew up with various amounts of technology do not have the chance to develop critical thought and creativity; weakening vital skills needed to survive in the world. The way people use social media and internet is bouncing from one place to another, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on one task such as simply reading a novel. Nickolas Carr admits “I can’t read War and Peace anymore”
Before technology was yet to exist, face-to-face interactions were a normal everyday encounter. Today's society there are severe cases of social anxiety. The unceasing celebration of the self — epitomized by the “selfie” photograph — has atomized and alienated the individual. Before, people would start off the day by looking at someone of importance to them such as a mother or significant other, nowadays the majority will start the off by subconsciously looking at a cellphone or some sort of gadget. Statistically, it takes approximately 21 days to create a habit. Which is silently lethal for anybody to own a mobile device. They become addicted to looking at their phone every 5 minutes, or waking up and checking social media feed, same thing for post sleeping. It has created problems in the educational system; students have been granted easy access to the internet utilities and have allowed them to easily locate, copy and paste answers into their homework assignments. The effects of exposure caused some to not be aware that it is creating reliability. Access to the internet has made plagiarism a part of several students’ academic careers, within has a contradiction, that being technology is a huge distraction from student staying focused on homework.
The invention of technology main purpose was to fill void, need, or want, creating an environment of simplicity. But, as technology grew it brought with it disorders, addiction and cognitive loss. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have slowly become a faster and more convenient way of sharing news, communication with friends and relatives across the world. Although citizen journalism has now become so cheap that anyone with a smart phone can transmit news anyhow, there have been instances where people have come to know of the gruesome deaths of their relatives and friends through uncensored posts on Facebook or WhatsApp. However, social media has became quite demoralizing and exposing the world to horribleness. Exposure to these types of graphic content develops immunization to what is known to be morally incorrect. In today's time, most of the human aspects of life revolve and are controlled or affected in someway by technology. Many people would find it hard to cook without microwaves. Technology had a goal originally set in place; it was to simply make human life easier, and it did in some ways, however the simplicity became a habit to the way people live their everyday lives. People became reluctant without it, something so simple as to driving from point A to B became a challenge without the use of a GPS or smartphone.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*ThszwI1P88-uosC0']",/@nathan.james?source=post_page---byline--7777ae670ee---------------------------------------

Ces nouveaux défis ne résultent pas de la création de nouvelles méthodes de réalisation d’abus de marché, mais du fait que les nouvelles technologies, et notamment l’Intelligence Artificielle, font que ceux-ci prennent une toute autre dimension.
Au sens du Règlement n°596/2014 [1], l’abus de marché se décompose de plusieurs catégories d’infractions : les opérations d’initiés, la divulgation illicite d’informations privilégiées, et les manipulations de marchés. Si les deux premières catégories relèvent d’un accès suivi d’une divulgation d’informations non publiques dont par conséquent l’IA ne peut avoir connaissance et ne peut donc générer de risques systémiques sur les marchés, cela n’est pas le cas pour la troisième catégorie. Les manipulations de marché sont définies, à travers d’une liste non-exhaustive, à l’article 12 du Règlement, remplaçant les articles 631 et suivants du Règlement général de l’AMF. Il y est notamment mentionné certaines manipulations de cours auxquelles il faut être particulièrement attentif dès lors qu’il y a usage du Trading algorithmique à haute fréquence, (par exemple à l’article 12 2.c du Règlement). Nous étudierons, au prisme de la pratique deMarket-on-the-close(A) et de celle de l’Abusive Squeeze(B), en quoi l’Intelligence Artificielle (en sa définition la plus inclusive possible) génère déjà des abus de marché afin d’illustrer les risques encourus par les marchés financiers dans le cadre d’une généralisation de ces agents autonomes.
IA et Marking-the-close
LeMarking-the-close[1bis]est le fait pour un agent financier de réaliser « des achats d’actions ou de dérivés à un instant très proche de fermeture du marché de façon à altérer le prix de clôture »[2]. Si un tel procédé n’est pas illégal en soi, la répétition de celui-ci dans des proportions permettant une influence sur les cours peut constituer une manipulation de cours. De plus, un tel procédé est suspectéa fortioride manipulation de cours s’il est suivi d’annulations des ordres passés. Car, pour tout investisseur extérieur, les informations disponibles sur l’état du marché de l’actif financier visé sont celles répertoriées dans le carnet d’ordres passés.
Dès lors, pour une entreprise réalisant ce type de procédé, le fait d’effectuer cela à grande échelle entraîne que « la représentation pour tout opérateur du carnet d’ordres et de l’état de l’offre et de la demande […] est faussée (sic) »[3]. En effet, compte tenu du caractère anonyme des opérations passées, « l’algorithme (peut) interpréter les flux de marché avantageusement par rapport aux autres intervenants » dès lors que seul l’émetteur de l’ordre est en mesure d’identifier ses propres ordres et donc d’avoir une vision réelle des ordres qui seront par la suite maintenus et effectués.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*HklnRNxhSrpq3GQCb1Lusw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*HklnRNxhSrpq3GQCb1Lusw.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*HklnRNxhSrpq3GQCb1Lusw.jpeg']",/@juris_morituri?source=post_page---byline--b89975517697---------------------------------------

On January 2nd, Damo Academy has released the “Top 10 Trends of Science and Technology” in 2019, covering smart cities, digital identity, autonomous driving, graph neural network systems, AI chips, blockchains, 5G. Alibaba’s Damo Academy has focused people on cutting-edge technologies that truly create value, providing theoretical support and a source of imagination for the technology development of 2019.
In 2019, AI remains the hottest topic in the tech world. If 2018 is the year of AI steps out from laboratory and step in​​to our reality “world”, we believe in 2019 is the year of a new starting point for the full cooperation between humans and AI tech. Damo Academy believes that real-time speech generation on mobile devices may not be distinguishable from live voice, and even voice AI will pass the Turing test in some specific conversations. There will be more and more talking facilities in our cities in the future.
Damo Academy believes that biometrics will enter a large-scale application phase in 2019. In the past few years, many people have become accustomed to going out without a wallet and cash. In the future, the era of going to the world without an ID card will not be too far away. With the rapid spread of 3D sensors and the integration of multiple biometrics, each device can “see” and “listen” which in other words, they become “smarter”. Biometric and vivo technologies will reshape identity and certification. Digital identity will become the person’s second identity card.
In addition, the Damo Court believes that in 2019, 5G will lead to a new application scenario, 5G will greatly enhance mobile bandwidth, provide a peak rate of nearly 100 times that of 4G, and enhance connectivity to 10 billion levels.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png']",/@statecrafttech?source=post_page---byline--417ab53ef494---------------------------------------

The show is about 5 friends who found a tech company in Silicon Valley and their hilarious journey through entrepreneurship and friendship. The clip below is from season 4 and sets the stage for my review of the very cool technology using machine learning to identify foods from photos.
As funny as this Silicon segment is, it would be hard to admit that the technology demonstrated by Jian Yang isn't impressive. To think that you could take a photo of any food and your phone would automatically recognize it is pretty cool. To take it a step further, if the technology could break down the foods nutrition facts and then log it in a food diary for the user- that would be incredibly valuable. The applications for a technology like that range from diabetes management to weight loss to allergic reaction prevention. It might appear as if this is an improbable machine learning abstraction, but if you look closer you will find that this technology is very real.

1. Changing Regulatory Requirements
Digital health care is driving many innovations across industries, especially pharma. However, companies, industries and regulators are not always in sync when it comes to developing sound compliance protocols. Automation, for example, is revolutionizing the way companies address many processes, including the documentation and reporting required for compliance.
Companies need to be responsive to rapidly evolving market demands, while at the same time meeting the changing, different, and detailed regulatory requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European markets and other regions.
However, for pharma companies to rely on automation and other emerging technologies, there needs to be greater confidence in core areas, including:","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*CScsP05gB2LojgaZB0OBgA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*CScsP05gB2LojgaZB0OBgA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*CScsP05gB2LojgaZB0OBgA.png']",/@roy_4457?source=post_page---byline--da45e39ed7ce---------------------------------------

The stereo playing the beat laid on the bed next to the mic stand and I remember freestyling about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It was 2006 and the business of music was entirely different. Limewire was still the beast it was and I spent most of my middle school days online sharing my music on Bebo & Myspace with SoundClick players and YouTube videos. Feel old yet or were you even around then?
Today’s climate of distribution and consumption has evolved well beyond pirating music via torrent software. Much like the transitions from cassette to CD, CD to mp3 and now mp3 to streaming, we are currently living in the next transition, immersive technology and decentralized music blockchain platforms. But what doest that mean and how can the industry, the artists and the various stakeholders stay ahead of the curve?
By 2021, virtual & augmented reality, cryptocurrency and other blockchain technology is expected to make waves into the mainstream. A treasured experience of traveling to a record store and playing that brand new CD in your car will change to paying musicians in crypto and receiving access to a virtual reality album release party. Every time a transition occurs as a byproduct of technology, the industry can’t keep up and a window opens for artists to take back more control. And as technology becomes readily accessible to consumers and market developers, the idea of independents disrupting is a greater possibility. But with anything, a financial investment is required to convert noise into purposeful attention. But this is were the new artist development walks in.
As the industry adapts to the changes of technology, artists have the greatest opportunity to retain ownership and rights in how their intellectual property is exploited. Gone are the days of middlemen controlling the logistics of how your works can be distributed and consumed. We live in an era were creatives get to explore, innovate and add their contribution to culture. Musicians have the ability to segment current and potential fans and tailor experiences for those segmented audiences. Whether you have the infrastructure to take your music to the world or create a hyperlocal experience for your die hard fans, it’s time to get the most creative.

We opened our eyes for the first time as a company to a whole planet actively taking massive strides at being a kinder and more accepting place to live. In effort to capture this magic our office sat down, shaking off the glow of holiday gluttony and that “one” drink on New Years, to reflect on the top moments of 2018 that deeply inspired us. Naturally, we looked inward to our very own values as the guide to our thoughts. We must admit in doing this we all had a “holy shit” moment when we realized what a prolific year it has been for us all.
Here is our official 2018 review inspired by our values:
We embrace all forms of diversity from ethnicity to experience. The process of building harmony can be messy but the results are powerful and more than worth it.
1.)Hollywood woke TFU to the fact that movie goers are craving stories that reflect global culture and represent difference in an authentic and somewhat epic way.Groundbreaking movies like Black Panther, Crazy Rich Asians and Oceans 8, which earned $700m, $250m and $300m at the box office respectively have finally proven that minority casts and women can deliver blockbuster returns in their own right.
2.) 2018 was the year of women in action.From #MeToo mobilizing deeper impact in every industry to Oprah’s speech at the Golden Globes to the female takeover of the Midterm elections to women driving in Saudi Arabia to the Royal Wedding of Megan and Harry we watched first after first that changed history.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*qiRGyaqpRXXMrJmv.png']",/@JordanMarieS?source=post_page---byline--8f28326fcf77---------------------------------------

And here we are now, the next big thing in the history of the industrial revolution — The Fourth one. It is getting much attention and hailed as important a milestone as the first one. Let’s have a look at why is that?
Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is all about connectedness and how we can embed the technology into our societies and industries.

Here is the transcript:
1. What advice would you give to a student that is looking to venture into this field?
I would advise to focus on one aspect of digital marketing per say and become an expert at it; however, I would highly recommend that you do not limit yourself to one aspect of Digital Marketing. You should be aware and knowledgeable of all aspects of what Digital Market offers to its audience. If you are a graphic designer; learn Photoshop, InDesign, but also study UX, web development, Marketing/Social Media Strategies. The more you understand of Digital Marketing conceptually and the various facets/marketing vehicles it offers and how they work; the more marketable you become as a Potential Hire. Furthermore, by learning all aspects of this field, it can help assist your creativity and/or make your Marketing strategies more effective.
Keep Learning. There are several online tools and courses available for anyone to continue their education and practice. A lot of resources are free and there are several Digital Marketing Experts who have insightful online blogs, courses, Twitter Chats, etc. that one can take advantage of. The Tech and Digital Marketing field is constantly changing; so staying connected, learning and practicing is highly recommended.

1月2日，阿里巴巴達摩院發布了“2019十大科技趨勢”，涵蓋了智能城市、數字身份、自動駕駛、圖神經網絡系統、AI芯片、區塊鏈、5G等領域。在經濟下行壓力增大的大環境下，阿里巴巴達摩院讓人們聚焦到真正創造價值的前沿技術，為2019年的發展提供理論支撐和想像力源泉。
2019年，AI依然將是科技界最熱的方向。如果說2018年AI從實驗室走入了現實，那麼，2019年將開啟人類和AI全面合作的新起點。達摩院認為，移動設備上的實時語音生成與真人語音可能將無法區分，甚至語音AI在一些特定對話中將會通過圖靈測試。在城市裡，會說話的公共設施將會越來越多。
AI技術雖然發展最熱，但比它更快進入成熟階段的是生物識別技術。達摩院認為，2019年，生物識別技術將進入大規模應用階段。過去幾年，很多人開始習慣出門不帶錢包，不帶現金，而未來，不帶身份證走遍天下的時代也將不會太遙遠。隨著3D傳感器的快速普及、多種生物特徵的融合，每個設備都能更聰明地“看”和“聽”。生物識別和活體技術將重塑身份識別和認證，數字身份將成為人的第二張身份證。","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*He9IkaHCy6kIuvnx60ixmA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*3FjConaJT6Rsw3a1G__Gjg.png']",/@statecrafttech?source=post_page---byline--a7ce7258e92a---------------------------------------

There are eight modern iPhones to choose from if you count the Plus models and last year’s iPhone X; four Apple Watch options; five iPads; and seven Macs before you even start to adjust their specs.
Though the rate at which people replace their old phones hasslowed, they’re still upgrading within two years on average, and Apple sold more than216 millioniPhones last year. The dizzying cost-benefit calculation happens all the time.

Building upon the success of the last two installments, the SugarCRM Sales Kick Off is all set to take Monterey, California, by storm and set the stage for a successful year for the Cupertino-based company.
So what’s in store? Well, lots of good stuff for one. The Sales Kick Off itself is basically an event that brings together the sales teams of a particular industry to share insights, business practices, strategies and more for a collective improvement across the board. Last year’sSugarCRM Sales Kick Off FY’19 in Italy was one of the biggest events of 2018 and included a number of different hands-on training and workshop sessions for all SugarCRM Partners. A lot of it is still under wraps about this year’s event but we can rest assured that this year’s event will surely include:
To increase Sales, you need all your cogs working coherently, and this includes knowing the products inside out. At SugarCRM Sales Kick Off, expect Sugar to conduct thorough hands-on training on a number of products, both old and new, to ensure all of their Partners are up to speed with the new and improved versions in order to sell better. SugarCRM must have multiple products lined up for 2019 so its a safe bet to assume these hands-on training sessions are going to hold something unique for all those in attendance.
Networking, the golden chalice of business relationships. SugarCRM Sales Kick Off will bring together Sugar Partners from all over the globe to interact, engage, and discuss all things Sugar. This is an excellent opportunity for Sugar Partners, Sales representatives, and Executives to connect, share insights and collaborate for collective benefit. Certain industries in certain regions of the world might be using aSugarCRM Customizationthat is unknown in another region. Events such as Sales Kick off present an excellent opportunity for cross-regional collaboration.

You want to know why people aren’t buying your new phones? Well, several issues. Your stuff doesn’t work together anymore. Or if it does work together, it does so to the detriment of the customer, of the user.
I bought a new desktop last year. It no longer has a disc drive of any kind. I could not upload my music to it off the ipad or iphone, which are both older. When I got the ipad and phone initially, they were newer than my computer, so I couldn’t really synch them either.
However, they are apparently synched enough so if I delete pics off the ipad or phone, they get deleted on the computer. Which, ARGH.
I keep hesitating to buy a new phone, even though the old one is on its last legs, and now refuses to actually ring. Why? in part, security. In part, I want my music, thank you. I also don’t WANT a huge phone. I have an ipad for that. I have small hands. I know other people who keep hoping you will come out with something smaller.

https://medium.com/@xcelcorp/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-5b6edab1a6e2?source=tag_archive---------171-----------------------,Blockchain — The Invisible Technology,"['Written by XCEL Corp', 'No responses yet']",,4 min read,XCEL Corp,"Researchers and technologists alike are excited about the rise of blockchain technology, which is foretold to be the next colossal innovation that will help companies garner wealth and resources. This, clearly, seems to have caught everyone’s fancy. So, what exactly is it?
An append-only ledger, in a blockchain, users can add new information, without editing, erasing or adjusting any previous information. That is why the data is stored in the form of blocks using cryptography that links contents from the newly added block into the one that is already existing before it. The technology is designed in a manner that any change to the contents of a previous block in the chain would invalidate the data in all the blocks after it. Purely driven by consensus, it works on the principle of network and connectivity of a large number of computers thus reducing malicious transactional invasions by an attacker.
There are orchestrations and applications of older principal technologies that are combined to create a blockchain. They are the private key cryptography, a ledger and an incentive to service the transaction such as security and record-keeping. Purposefully, possession of a combination of public and private cryptographic keys create a secure digital identity and reference. The amalgamation is seen as a dexterous form of consent and also regarded as a digital signature, which, in turn, provides control of ownership. Since the technology accommodates a large network of validators, this remains one of the blockchain’s most attractive attributes since it amasses large computing power.
At the same time, if we’re to distill the usage of the blockchain, the primary benefit of the underlying technology is to address the problem of double-spending. Predominantly used in the creation and maintenance of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain is susceptible to counter issues where there is a risk of a holder sending copies of the same bitcoin into different transactions advancing the notorious double-spending.
A block is created with the details about the transaction and is broadcasted to all the nodes each time a new transaction takes place. A reference to the previous block in the chain is carried by every new block with a timestamp, thus establishing a sequence of events. The new block gets linked to the previous block when the authenticity of the transaction is proven. When such a chain of blocks is replicated across the network, all of them are cryptographically secured which makes hacking virtually impossible.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*ZrOIcleiLslJKGeatw7uYA.png']",/@xcelcorp?source=post_page---byline--5b6edab1a6e2---------------------------------------

Sorry, Siri, but I find you and Alexa creepy. I worry that native intelligence is being replaced by “artificial intelligence,” which strikes me as a modern-day oxymoron, like “virtual reality.” I’m scared about what’s coming as technology takes over our lives. And I’m nearly convinced robots are going to make humans unnecessary if not extinct. Call me crazy, but that’s what they called Jules Verne too.
It seems I’m in good company. Some pretty big names in science and technology have also expressed concern about the inherent risks AI could pose. They include the late physicist Stephen Hawking who told the BBC several years ago that, “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.” Elon Musk, engineer and head of Tesla, has said that autonomous machines could unleash “weapons of terror,” comparing the adoption of AI to “summoning the devil.” And Bill Gates is worried that AI is only viable if we make sure humans remain in control of machines.
As one techie posted on Tech Times.com, what happens if Siri decides that she wants to take over the world? He didn’t seem to think that was a real threat, but what if AI becomes so advanced that it decides it wants power of its own? Others worry that if artificially intelligent systems misunderstand a mission they’re given, they could cause more damage than good and end up hurting lots of people.
A lot of folks are worried about the implications of AI-controlled weapons. They might be able to help soldiers and civilians in war zones, but they could also cause a global arms race that could end up being disastrous. According to a scientist at the Future of Life Institute, “There is an appreciable probability that the course of human history over the next century will be dramatically affected by how AI is developed. It would be extremely unwise to leave this to chance,” he argues.
There are also troubling ways in which AI could infringe upon our personal privacy. Facebook’s recent problems have already demonstrated some of the possibilities, from unwanted intrusion to exposure that leaves us vulnerable. Facebook can already recognize someone by the clothes they wear, the books they read, and the movies they watch. What happens when government agencies have fully developed recognition systems?","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*RGLgwGb5lgbzKjnKb1-lNg.jpeg']",/@eclift?source=post_page---byline--772612f1bbec---------------------------------------

The creation of new technology continues to impact and reshape the industry while improving the way doctors provide medical care. The benefits from each technological achievement work to bring us into a better future in healthcare, while eliminating systems that clearly do not provide the most accurate information.
Healthcare Informatics has taken the place of medical records and different healthcare systems to streamline the industry. Many of the developments are physical changes we can see such as new programs and systems for medical records and patient to physician interactions. Aside from the physical, there are other changes that continue to benefit and make way for the successful future of healthcare informatics.
Patients Taking Interest In Their HealthA great improvement that has been seen over the years informatics have been implemented, is the increase of patients taking an interest in their own health. Because patients now have access to their medical records and diagnoses, they’ve been more apt to stay up to date on appointments, which medications they should be taking, as well as their diagnoses and symptoms. This is also true in the fact that through patient portals, patients are able to speak directly to their doctors and nurses when they have any questions, concerns, or need something such as a refill on medication.
Knowledge and Communication Has IncreasedThere are so many different specialists in the healthcare industry that most patients are seeing multiple physicians on a yearly basis for different reasons. A huge advancement with healthcare informatics is how connected medical professionals are. Communication and sharing of information among each physician helps to provide patients with the best care possible. Keeping all information in one place that is easily accessible provides the knowledge needed to diagnose and treat patients with less unanswered questions and decreases the possibility for a misdiagnosis.
The best outcome from healthcare informatics is the increased level of quality care. Freeing up time from our medical professionals by having new technology and healthcare information systems creates not only quality care, but safer care for patients. With proper diagnosis’ and efficiency from medical staff, insurance companies, hospitals, and patients all save money in the long run. Thecontinued growth of healthcare technologywill transform the future of the medical industry.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*OWZ1AeRffWHapWStGvTKiQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*OWZ1AeRffWHapWStGvTKiQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*OWZ1AeRffWHapWStGvTKiQ.jpeg']",/?source=post_page---byline--a0aca1088475---------------------------------------

Leading enterprise robotic process automation (RPA) software company, UiPath, predicts that “everything will be accelerated in 2019”.
The company has newly released its top five predictions from some of its senior leaders. Kulpreet Singh, managing director EMEA, reckons the pace of automation will increase as large-scale RPA implementations advance rapidly in the region. He says they will be “turbo-charged” by the spread of expertise through widely available training programmes, new open marketplaces and the maturation of internal centres-of-excellence.
Singh adds that such implementations will progress more quickly in the EMEA region than other parts of the world, especially when it comes to deploying attended software robots in a wide range of settings.
UiPath also forecasts that automation will be “democratised” through global vendor education initiatives and that senior executives will back RPA and it will be easier to gain senior executive sponsorship for automation because its benefits have become so obvious.
While the predictions have far-reaching effects for workplaces and the world of business, they are both positive and indicative of howtechnologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and roboticsare being embedded into workplaces and work practices.

I work completely online now. I am constantly on my computer or my phone for work. I love that I can work as easily from my couch as in a library as an airport. Sometimes I still want a job that I get paid to do away from the computer, but the mobility for my international life really helps. I also have family and friends across the world, and the only way to talk to them is if I have some screen handy. I love that I can be there for friends and get news from home quickly. I love having my Mum or brother at the other end of the phone in a second — as easy as it is if we lived in the same neighborhood.
The problem is everything in between, when twenty minutes after I picked up my phone to look up something, I’m watching kids getting surprised by puppies and whoever Ellen just had on her show. That is on the good days of distraction. We all get addicted to scrolling through random posts, but this year, I want to read more. I want to write more. I want to spend more time thinking instead of being told what to think. I already deleted Snapchat because I couldn’t handle it all.
Just recently I was waiting at the Doctor’s office and of course, was scrolling through emails and Instagram. I had a flashback to what waiting rooms were like before smartphones. It was lucky if there were a pile of magazines in the corner. There weremanymoments spent sitting and looking at walls. In the car, if I forgot my book, I was subject to whatever music was on the radio and whatever was interesting outside the window. Thankfully, Ireallyliked books, so most of the time I was happy with waiting wherever. I just know there were many times that humans used to be forced to think for themselves and now, those moments seem to be much less frequent.
I’m starting with taking the advice from many articles and taking my phone away from my bedside. Still on ring, if there’s an emergency, it’ll be in my office. My bedside table will hopefully fill up with books and notebooks instead. When I was younger, I used to fall asleep with a book and wake up to read a bit before going downstairs and starting the day. It’s something that I think 2019 will welcome — plus I like coffee now so it’s an adult version.

First, let’s understand the push toward transparency over the years and where we’re headed in the year ahead. Let’s dig in.
How the Push for Healthcare Transparency Began
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines transparency in healthcare as making all information on quality, efficiency, and consumer experience clearly available to the public in a reliable and understandable manner. When done right, transparency efforts in healthcare can dramatically influence the behaviors of patients, providers, payers, and others to achieve better outcomes.
In the early part of the 20thcentury, Ernest Codman, M.D., a pioneering Boston surgeon, introduced the “end result idea” to highlight the importance of following up with each and every patient — and publicly reporting the results. Codman’s novel idea at the time was based on the theory that complete transparency would promote improvement throughout the hospital, encourage greater physician education, and improve patient choice at large.
While the foundation for patient transparency was set years ago, it wasn’t until 2001 that the IOM published recommendations for increased information availability, so that patients and families could make more informed choices. The IOM report brought attention to the need for a standardized set of performance indicators for safety, patient satisfaction, and outcomes to be made public. The movement toward informed healthcare choices was reinforced by proponents of Consumer-Driven Health Care (CDHC), an often-debated, market-driven approach to healthcare based on publicly available information on price and quality of care to encourage informed shopping for high-quality, low-cost healthcare.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*MZgf3-WtcC-GGDv_0TTCwQ.jpeg']",/@workpath?source=post_page---byline--db33e8e46a34---------------------------------------

In a world with so much focus on tech, robots, digitalisation, this-tech and that-tech, we really need to focus on the right people. Take the human qualities we are about to loose, back!
I was at a VERY good conference last fall. Hosted byOslo Business Forum: The Future of Technology. Consistently throughout the whole day, my reaction after every person leaving the main stage, was:you nailed it!Thats rarely the case when I go to conferences.
First of all, I was happy it was a lot about people — in the end, machines, robots and AIs wont be bias and evil, unless we, the makers are. So right people and diversity is more important than ever.

In fact, streaming has become the primary revenue driver for both music and video, thereby radically changing the way people consume content and profoundly altering the manner in which the industry and artists deliver media to fans.
Digital music downloads are quickly decliningand being replaced by streaming, and it’s easy to understand why this is occurring. For the price of a single digital album download, consumers can gain access to tens of millions of songs via streaming services. And a growing number of music fans are making this switch, with over 100 million people now subscribed to such services around the world. According to the RIAA’s 2017 mid-year report, the U.S. recorded music industry experienced a 17% revenue increase in the first half of this year in comparison to 2016, and the primary driver of that growth is streaming. While total digital revenue accounted for $3.2 billion, or 84% of the total industry value, an impressive 62% came from streaming, equaling $2.5 billion.
Video streaming revenue is also growingat a staggering rate with no signs of slowing down. According to a report by Research and Markets, video streaming revenue is forecast to increase from $30.29 billion in 2016 to an incredible $70.05 billion by 2021, as consumers continue to embrace pay TV and OTT solutions for streaming videos. Moving forward, it’s expected that OTT will experience the most substantial market growth rate based on the increasing use of digital platforms for the branding and marketing of products.
Among other things, streaming powers the growth of digital distribution, creating more opportunities for independent artists. The world of independent music distribution has also expanded greatly over the past year, as a growing number of artists move away from major label deals to harness the personalized attention that indies can provide. UK-born companyDitto Music recently opened 12 new officesworldwide to serve its flourishing roster, while digital distribution and services companyFUGA has signed a dealwith London-based Ignition Records, following its expanding partnerships with a multitude of labels, including Epitaph Records and Ultra Records. EvenGoogle is getting into the musicindustry with a big investment in the new US-based digital music distribution startup UnitedMasters, which was founded by the one-time President of Urban Music at Interscope Records, Steve Stoute.
Not surprisingly, the competition for streaming dollarshas been growing exponentially. One of the biggest recent stories wasDisney’s announcementthat it is severing its distribution deal with Netflix in favor of launching its own streaming service in 2019. And now it isofficially confirmedthat Disney is buying some of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets, including the Fox movie and television studio and a share of Hulu, which will allow Disney to increase its television production to provide exclusive content on its forthcoming streaming offering.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*N2Pvx-PAIdPZ8FUDlRWh0A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*kFWwYehzjJIhgw8hTygfHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*kFWwYehzjJIhgw8hTygfHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*kFWwYehzjJIhgw8hTygfHw.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*N2Pvx-PAIdPZ8FUDlRWh0A.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*N2Pvx-PAIdPZ8FUDlRWh0A.png']",/@dataart?source=post_page---byline--a1e3acd3b3ac---------------------------------------

Safety and antivirus apps are also great, but what if your device is infected already? If your Android device is suddenly slow, uses too much data or displays corrupted data, you could have downloaded an app infected with malware — or ransomware that is much more obvious.
Suspicious apps — frequently promising free work software, cheat codes, new games, porn or money — are an increasingly common way of getting viruses on your mobile devices, where they damage and steal data. If you still have access to your Android device, your first step should be to get rid of the infected app before it infects or damages other devices. This is how to locate and remove Android malware and a few security download options that will help protect you in the future.

De este modo, los antivirus trabajan con una gran base de datos integrada por los ciberataques que se han desarrollado con anterioridad, al tiempo que también repelen acciones similares en forma o alcance. No obstante, la imaginación de loshackerses proporcional a su capacidad para causar daños, yendo siempre un paso por delante de nuestros escudos pasivos. Por ello, cada vez más empresas apuestan por la protección activa que representan los “cazadores de ciberamenazas”.
La agencia SANS ha publicado un exhaustivo estudio que pasa revista al grado de adopción de estos peculiares “cazadores” en el ámbito corporativo. Un nada desdeñable 43% de las empresas consultadas afirman utilizar con cierta frecuencia este tipo de servicios, al tiempo que un considerable 65% reconocen que invertirán más dinero en ellos en los próximos dos años. ¿Cuál fue el detonante de esta tendencia en ciberseguridad? El propio informe de SANS nos da la respuesta. El 49% de las compañías que participaron en el estudio se encontraron en algún momento con amenazas que sus sistemas de seguridad no podían identificar.
Con todo, la actividad de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” no ha conseguido acabar todavía con algunos errores en materia de seguridadonlinemuy asentados. Por ejemplo, un 37% de las firmas analizadas por SANS no toman ninguna medida relevante hasta que sufren algún ataque. De este modo, la protección proactiva dista de ser un recurso extendido en el tejido empresarial norteamericano, a pesar de que los responsables de las compañías no discuten su interés. Para las grandes empresas, resulta imposible conjurar los riesgos en línea si no disponen de herramientas totalmente adaptadas a su modelo de negocio. La caza de amenazas no puede automatizarse por completo.
Los profesionales que se dedican a la caza de ciberamenazas trabajan con un gran número de variables a fin de detectar si están ante un nuevo tipo de ataque o si, simplemente, se trata de un repunte coyuntural de la actividad delictiva. Dentro de este segundo grupo de amenazas encontraríamos el aumento de las acciones durante los periodos en que la empresa registra más operaciones (durante las campañas comerciales, por ejemplo). Los modelos más avanzados de los “cazadores de ciberamenazas” permiten cribar con rapidez los ataques para centrarse en las acciones más peligrosas.

It is a two-horse race and I am sure we can all agree on that. Building a mobile application is not an easy task though.
For iOS, you write code using Objective-C or Swift and for Android, you will find yourself using Java. Apart from different programming languages used to create a mobile that can run on each of the two platforms, the toolchains are entirely different too for both of these mobile platforms.
Many modern-day developers use a specific set of technology that is used to build web applications: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are different frameworks that fall under the category commonly known as Hybrid applications. You can use almost one set of source code for developing the application for both iOS and Android platforms.
In recent years, hybrid frameworks have evolved coming from web view to use native APIs. This cross-platform approach of developing a mobile application comes with its own pros and cons. Pros such as being less-time consuming and cost-effective and cons include performance issues.
One great option that falls under the umbrella of cross-platform development is React Native. Developed and used by Facebook as well others such as Tesla, Walmart, Uber Eats, Instagram, Discord, Wix and so on. React Native is based on Facebook’s web library ReactJS.","['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*L2HqlPuCG1ULIVPiucnQ6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5D9oYBd58pyjMkV_5-zXXQ.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*L2HqlPuCG1ULIVPiucnQ6g.jpeg', 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*L2HqlPuCG1ULIVPiucnQ6g.jpeg']",https://medium.com/@amanhimself?source=post_page---byline--a41ebc0617e2---------------------------------------

A lot of people don’t know what an API is. API stands forApplication Programming Interface.As the name says, it is an interface with which people — developers, users, and consumers — can interact with data.
You can think of an API as a bartender. You ask the bartender for a drink, and they give you what you want. Simple. So why is that a problem?
Since the start of the modern web, building APIs has been easier than it sounds. But learning and understanding APIs was. Developers form the majority of the people that will use your API to build something or consume data. So your API should be as clean and as intuitive as possible. A well-designed API is straightforward to use and learn. It’s also intuitive, an excellent point to remember when you’re starting to design your API.
We’ve been using REST to build APIs for a long time. Along with that come some problems. When making an API using REST design, you’ll face some issues like:
